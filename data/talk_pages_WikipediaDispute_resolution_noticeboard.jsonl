The province is divided into districts, which are further divided into actual city propers which cover metropolitan Algiers.  There is no Algiers City, in that respect so this sentence in the beginning paragraph:\n\n\"According to the 1998 census, the population of the city proper was 1,519,570...\"\njh\nted local government for the urban area, or is there not really an Algiers city in terms of local governance? --[[User:Criticalthinker|Criticalthinker]] ([[User talk:Criticalthinker|talk]]) 12:52, 14 February 2011 (UTC)\n:Come on; someone has to know. --[[User:Criticalthinker|Criticalthinker]] ([[User talk:Criticalthinker|talk]]) 03:05, 8 September 2011 (UTC)\n\n== province and city ==\n\nthe article Algiers referrences both a coty and a province, I suggest they are seperated\n--[[User:The Brain|The Brain]] 11:47, 6 September 2005 (UTC)\n\nWhy is Algiers called the islands? There are no visible islands in the vicinity of algiers...--[[User:Burgas00|Burgas00]] 17:38, 1 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nThis is really quite a complex question.\nThe name of the city varied in the old times in Arabic: some wrote it \"jazayer\" others wrote it \"zayer\" (obviously this is vocal transliterations I'm writing with latin characters). \"jazayer\" means \"the islands\" in Arabic. \"zayer\" means absolutely nothing in Arabic. Anyways... as the city grew powerful in the middle ages it also became the name of the country Algeria (Algeria is called \"el jazayer\" today in Arabic) like Tunis to the East gave its name to Tunisia and Marakech to the West gave its name to Morocco. The thing is that in Algeria there is an Arab and a Berber culture. Today those who want to promote Arabic identity of Algeria claim that \"el jazayer\" means \"islands\" and is a proper Arabic word (just like el jazira, the TV station means \"the island\" or \"the peninsula\". singular). Those who want to promote Berber identity claim that in the historical books it was written more like \"zayer\" originally. So the 2 viewpoints are these:\n- \"zayer\", which means absolutely nothing if taken as a noun in Arabic comes from the fact that the man who rebuilt the city was called Ziri. And he was a Berber prince. \"Zayer\" therefore would mean \"Ziri's city\".\n- To make matters worse, those who support Arabic identity and the theory of \"the islands\" actually have a case too. There used to be 4 small islands in front of the old city which was much smaller than the modern Algiers. The old city was located in the left side of the bay on the satellite picture and it is today the Casbah district of modern Algiers. The islands got linked to the land however over centuries. The last island ceased to exist as an island in the 16th century. It was the one which the Spanish had built a massive fort with an artillery based there, from which they bombed the city continuously in order to obtain it's surrender in the 16th century. When the residents of Algiers captured the fort from the Spanish, they destroyed the fort and used its blocks to link this last island to the city. I think that was around in 1520. Over time therefore, there is no more islands left.\nSo the origin of the name of the city is a matter of discussion between Algerians themselves. The fact that the city gave it's name to the country makes the discussion a national one. And the fact that the government which suppressed Berber culture for a decades took sides with the Arabic theory of \"jazayer\" (also written djazair in latin characters) has pushed many defendants of Berber culture into the arms of the theory of \"zayer\" or the Berber prince [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]]'s city. What exactely is the truth? I personally don't know but I think that its both at the same time. Voil\u00e0 for this quite Mediteranean dispute over a name :)\nCordially, a resident of Algiers [[User:82.101.153.210|82.101.153.210]] 06:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)\n\nThe Arabic version has the longer documented history, as [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri]] writing in the 11th century calls it \"the islands\" belonging some tribe I forget who. And I've also seen it somewhere that the Phoenician name ''Ikosim'' meant ''seagull islands''. Anyway, is it not odd that neither Arab nor Berber explanation of the name is given in the article, but another one?

It undertakes an opening towards the world by organizing many demonstrations and international conferences. Algiers has attracted thus for a few years of great multinationals such as [[Crossroads]], [[Yves Rocher]], or [[Quick]]. Many great projects of realization of infrastructures such as [[subway of Algiers]], it [[tram]] like various projects of urban reorganization, of creation of new satellite urban centres, pain to be born, though they should have been completed there is more than 15 years: Algiers is in full urban development, moved by a need for assertion at the regional level in its fight to compete with the other North-African cities of [[Tunisia]] and of [[Morocco]]. For the year 2007, Algiers is capital \u201cArab culture\u201d. On April 11, 2007, one Attacks of Algiers of April 11, 2007 double atttendants to the bomb aims at the palate of the government (where seat the Prime Minister and the Minister of Interior Department) and the police station of Bab-Ezzouar.

I am posting my translation of the \"Years 2000\" section that looked like a google translation of the equivalent section of the French article on Algiers.  I removed some info and POV but a translation can't work miracles, the source text itself is not the greatest... Anyways, here it is, let me know what you think.\n\n::''Algiers in the 21st Century''\n::Today, in 2007, Algiers is seeking to once again become an important African and Mediterranean capital, envisioning having a comparable level of infrastructure development to what it had in 1962 relative to other countries.  Algiers is opening itself up to the world by hosting a variety of international conferences and events.  This new openness has attracted the investment of a number of multinational companies in recent years, such as:  Carrefour, Yves Rocher, and even Quick.  However, many large infrastructure projects are struggling to be completed:  the Algiers subway, the tramway, urban renewal projects, the creation of new urban centers on the periphery.  The current infrastructure has not been able to keep up with Algier's rapid growth.\n\n::2007 has brought mixed results for Algiers.  On the postive side the city has been named the capital of \"Arab culture\" for 2007.  On the negative side, a double bombing attack ocurred on April 11 with one bomb targeting the government building housing the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior; and another bomb targeting the police station in Bab-Ezzouar.  The attacks were claimed by an organization calling themselves the Maghreb branch of Al-Qaida.\n\n::Algiers is currently ranked lowest out of 132 capitals in the Economist Intellegince Unit's quality of life survey.  The survey takes into consideration 40 different criteria divided into 5 categories:  stability, health services, culture and environment, education, and the availability of basic services.  Algiers was ranked lower than such cities as Karachi (Pakistan), Tripoli (Libya), Abidjan (C\u00f4te-d'Ivoire), and even Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.  In 2005 the same survey ranked Algiers 125th out of 129 cities.  [[User:Vrac|Vrac]] 07:17, 3 December 2007 (UTC)\n\n== Someone needs to do some major editing here.... ==\n\nThis is terrible.

For instance, the French Commission nationale de toponymie\u2019s 2021 list of world territorial divisions, for DZ.16, gives: \"Nom du chef-lieu en arabe: El Djeza\u00efr / Al Jaz\u0101\u02beir.

The province is divided into districts, which are further divided into actual city propers which cover metropolitan Algiers.  There is no Algiers City, in that respect so this sentence in the beginning paragraph:\n\n\"According to the 1998 census, the population of the city proper was 1,519,570...\"\njh\nted local government for the urban area, or is there not really an Algiers city in terms of local governance? --[[User:Criticalthinker|Criticalthinker]] ([[User talk:Criticalthinker|talk]]) 12:52, 14 February 2011 (UTC)\n:Come on; someone has to know. --[[User:Criticalthinker|Criticalthinker]] ([[User talk:Criticalthinker|talk]]) 03:05, 8 September 2011 (UTC)\n\n== province and city ==\n\nthe article Algiers referrences both a coty and a province, I suggest they are seperated\n--[[User:The Brain|The Brain]] 11:47, 6 September 2005 (UTC)\n\nWhy is Algiers called the islands? There are no visible islands in the vicinity of algiers...--[[User:Burgas00|Burgas00]] 17:38, 1 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nThis is really quite a complex question.\nThe name of the city varied in the old times in Arabic: some wrote it \"jazayer\" others wrote it \"zayer\" (obviously this is vocal transliterations I'm writing with latin characters). \"jazayer\" means \"the islands\" in Arabic. \"zayer\" means absolutely nothing in Arabic. Anyways... as the city grew powerful in the middle ages it also became the name of the country Algeria (Algeria is called \"el jazayer\" today in Arabic) like Tunis to the East gave its name to Tunisia and Marakech to the West gave its name to Morocco. The thing is that in Algeria there is an Arab and a Berber culture. Today those who want to promote Arabic identity of Algeria claim that \"el jazayer\" means \"islands\" and is a proper Arabic word (just like el jazira, the TV station means \"the island\" or \"the peninsula\". singular). Those who want to promote Berber identity claim that in the historical books it was written more like \"zayer\" originally. So the 2 viewpoints are these:\n- \"zayer\", which means absolutely nothing if taken as a noun in Arabic comes from the fact that the man who rebuilt the city was called Ziri. And he was a Berber prince. \"Zayer\" therefore would mean \"Ziri's city\".\n- To make matters worse, those who support Arabic identity and the theory of \"the islands\" actually have a case too. There used to be 4 small islands in front of the old city which was much smaller than the modern Algiers. The old city was located in the left side of the bay on the satellite picture and it is today the Casbah district of modern Algiers. The islands got linked to the land however over centuries. The last island ceased to exist as an island in the 16th century. It was the one which the Spanish had built a massive fort with an artillery based there, from which they bombed the city continuously in order to obtain it's surrender in the 16th century. When the residents of Algiers captured the fort from the Spanish, they destroyed the fort and used its blocks to link this last island to the city. I think that was around in 1520. Over time therefore, there is no more islands left.\nSo the origin of the name of the city is a matter of discussion between Algerians themselves. The fact that the city gave it's name to the country makes the discussion a national one. And the fact that the government which suppressed Berber culture for a decades took sides with the Arabic theory of \"jazayer\" (also written djazair in latin characters) has pushed many defendants of Berber culture into the arms of the theory of \"zayer\" or the Berber prince [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]]'s city. What exactely is the truth? I personally don't know but I think that its both at the same time. Voil\u00e0 for this quite Mediteranean dispute over a name :)\nCordially, a resident of Algiers [[User:82.101.153.210|82.101.153.210]] 06:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)\n\nThe Arabic version has the longer documented history, as [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri]] writing in the 11th century calls it \"the islands\" belonging some tribe I forget who. And I've also seen it somewhere that the Phoenician name ''Ikosim'' meant ''seagull islands''. Anyway, is it not odd that neither Arab nor Berber explanation of the name is given in the article, but another one?

Anyways, here it is, let me know what you think.\n\n::''Algiers in the 21st Century''\n::Today, in 2007, Algiers is seeking to once again become an important African and Mediterranean capital, envisioning having a comparable level of infrastructure development to what it had in 1962 relative to other countries.  Algiers is opening itself up to the world by hosting a variety of international conferences and events.  This new openness has attracted the investment of a number of multinational companies in recent years, such as:  Carrefour, Yves Rocher, and even Quick.  However, many large infrastructure projects are struggling to be completed:  the Algiers subway, the tramway, urban renewal projects, the creation of new urban centers on the periphery.  The current infrastructure has not been able to keep up with Algier's rapid growth.\n\n::2007 has brought mixed results for Algiers.  On the postive side the city has been named the capital of \"Arab culture\" for 2007.  On the negative side, a double bombing attack ocurred on April 11 with one bomb targeting the government building housing the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior; and another bomb targeting the police station in Bab-Ezzouar.  The attacks were claimed by an organization calling themselves the Maghreb branch of Al-Qaida.\n\n::Algiers is currently ranked lowest out of 132 capitals in the Economist Intellegince Unit's quality of life survey.  The survey takes into consideration 40 different criteria divided into 5 categories:  stability, health services, culture and environment, education, and the availability of basic services.  Algiers was ranked lower than such cities as Karachi (Pakistan), Tripoli (Libya), Abidjan (C\u00f4te-d'Ivoire), and even Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.  In 2005 the same survey ranked Algiers 125th out of 129 cities.  [[User:Vrac|Vrac]] 07:17, 3 December 2007 (UTC)\n\n== Someone needs to do some major editing here.... ==\n\nThis is terrible.

La mesure du sens et le sens de la mesure'', 2015.</ref> In that paper and in his later piece on language policy and toponymy, he notes that no Algerian mother tongue (Arabic dialects or Amazigh) actually pronounces the official ''al-jazair'', but uses the local form ''dzayer'', from which ''dziri'' and Amazigh forms like ''adziri/adzayri'' for the inhabitants are derived.<ref>Mohand Tilmatine, \"Politique linguistique et toponymie en Alg\u00e9rie: quelle place pour l\u2019amazighit\u00e9 en Alg\u00e9rie?\", CRASC/HCA, 2013.</ref> The Berber reading \"dziri > d(a) Ziri\" is clearly marked as a possible analysis and explicitly attributed to anthropologist Tassadit Yacine. Again, that is discussed as a hypothesis in peer-reviewed Amazigh studies, not as a blog-level claim.\n::::* On the status of \"Dzayer\": here the sources are quite clear that this is not a marginal word. Tilmatine\u2019s whole point is that none of the Algerian native languages realise the official ''al-jazair'', but the local variant ''dzayer'' for the capital/country name, from which the demonyms are formed.<ref>Tilmatine, \"Politique linguistique et toponymie en Alg\u00e9rie\", cited above.</ref> In addition, recent toponymic standards explicitly record ''Dzayer'' (or ''Ldzayr'') as the Amazigh name for Algiers. For instance, the French Commission nationale de toponymie\u2019s 2021 list of world territorial divisions, for DZ.16, gives: \"Nom du chef-lieu en arabe: El Djeza\u00efr / Al Jaz\u0101\u02beir. En berb\u00e8re: Dzayer\".<ref>Commission nationale de toponymie (CNIG), ''Divisions territoriales des pays du monde'', 2021, p. 6, entry DZ.16 Alger.</ref> The UK PCGN \"Algeria: Toponymic Factfile\" similarly lists, for DZ-16, Arabic \"Al Jaz\u0101\u2019ir\" and Tamazight \"\u2d4d\u2d37\u2d63\u2d30\u2d62\u2d54 (Ldzayr)\".<ref>Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (PCGN), ''Algeria: Toponymic Factfile'', 2025, p. 8.</ref> So \"Dzayer\"/\"Ldzayr\" is in fact the standardised Amazigh name for the city and wilaya.\n::::So, from the sources, we do not have \"a single linguist and a random word\", but:\n::::* a mainstream line (including Haddadou and standard encyclopedias) that derives ''Algiers'' from Arabic ''al-Jazair'' \"the islands\", and\n::::* a small number of specialists in Amazigh linguistics/onomastics (Morsly, Tilmatine, Dabouz, plus Yacine as cited by Tilmatine) who discuss whether the popular forms ''dzayer''/''dziri'' might preserve a Berber/Zirid layer under the later Arabic toponym.\n::::Per [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:UNDUE]], that does not justify presenting the Berber/Zirid hypothesis as equal to the islands etymology, but it does justify a single, clearly qualified sentence noting that \"a few linguists working on Amazigh and Algerian toponymy have tentatively proposed a Berber/Zirid origin for the popular forms ''dzayer''/''dziri''\", while keeping the Arabic explanation as the majority view. [[User:Boutboul|Michael Boutboul]] ([[User talk:Boutboul|talk]]) 17:45, 29 November 2025 (UTC)\n:::::With respect:\n:::::*Dalila Morsly is not saying that \"Dzayer\" is a Berber name.

It is based on a lecture by Leschi in 1941. Therefore, what is required to support the Berber hypothesis of the word is not required for the Arabic hypothesis...\n:::::::* {{tq|Dalila Morsly is not saying that \"Dzayer\" is a Berber name.}} This is contradicted by what the author writes. At the very least, no one can rule out that it postulates the hypothesis of the contraction of {{tq|ceux de Ziri}} (p.12).\n:::::::* {{tq|that isn't even the common name of the subject (al-Jazair)}} : this is a personal opinion that directly contradicts Dalila Morsly : {{tq|M\u00eame r\u00e9appropriation chez G.

This passage is interesting because 1) the \"centrality\" of old, obsolete academic sources around Al Jazair is criticized (Esquer was writing at the same time as Leschi) 2) Dzayer is a name among Arabic and Berber speakers, the most common one, it does not have to be obscured in the article in favor of (the only mention) Al Jazair.\n:::::::* The Dziri/Dzayer debate is pointless; a language can offer two possible roots for a proper noun.

(1) Why does the Infobox distinguish between \"legal\" successor states and \"territorial\" successor states. that's highly unusual. (2) The 2 \"legal\" successor states are both generally unrecognised states. How can they, under international law, be termed \"legal\" successor states? What's the sourcing for that? Infoboxes should only contain simple straightforward information. Complexity has to be avoided. If there's any complexity in what the sucessor states are then the paramater shouldn't be used. [[User:DeCausa|DeCausa]] ([[User talk:DeCausa|talk]]) 00:02, 23 November 2025 (UTC)\n*:Maybe [[User:Havsj\u00f6|<bdi>Havsj\u00f6</bdi>]] did this 3 years ago https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Austria-Hungary&diff=prev&oldid=1119949236 it seems it did not bother anyone for 3 years.\n*:Probably because there are many new modern states in the area of AH, and it is a clarification that imperal Austria is the direct predecessor legal state as modern Austria, and royal Hungary is the direct predecessor legal state as modern Hungary. That is clear that not Italy or Romania is the legal successor state of imperial Austria or royal Hungary just because they got land from AH. And this is not about the borders, but about the statehood.  [[User:OrionNimrod|OrionNimrod]] ([[User talk:OrionNimrod|talk]]) 16:23, 23 November 2025 (UTC)\n*::Well it seems to me the case that: (1) having 2 unrecognised states as the so-called \"legal successor\" is incorrect and needs to be changed (2) having the actual legal successor states there might be a possibility albeit with a chronological gap. But the presentation of that complexity appropriately will be problematic. Complexity is not what Infoboxes are for.(3) Distinguishing between legal successors and territorial successors is very unusual in Infoboxes (most likely because of the types of complexity mentioned in 2). It begs the question why is this Infobox to be different to all the others? I propose it should just list the territorial successors or failing that have nothing in the parameter (which I know has been the solution where complexities have prevented easy agreement).

Any other flag is either a flag of only part of the empire, or purely naval in use.\n\nBut this is frequently used to represent the nationality of a person, e.g. in the infobox for [[World Chess Championship 1886]].  There were multiple nations within the empire, and it seems to me that it would be correct to use one of the flags in the country data template as Cisleithania and Transleithania for most people rather than the general Austria-Hungary flag.\n\nWhat can be done to signpost infobox editors to use these flags rather the generic one when they want a flag for a person? [[User:Po8crg|Richard Gadsden]] ([[User talk:Po8crg|talk]]) 18:51, 25 November 2025 (UTC)\n:Per [[mos:INFOBOXFLAG]] flag icons shouldn't normally be used in Infoboxes. In the limited circumstances when they can be used then the flag of the relevant Habsburg state should be used. It would be wrong, for instance, to use the black and gold flag for a Hungarian or a Croatian, for instance.

(1) Why does the Infobox distinguish between \"legal\" successor states and \"territorial\" successor states. that's highly unusual. (2) The 2 \"legal\" successor states are both generally unrecognised states. How can they, under international law, be termed \"legal\" successor states? What's the sourcing for that? Infoboxes should only contain simple straightforward information. Complexity has to be avoided. If there's any complexity in what the sucessor states are then the paramater shouldn't be used.

That is clear that not Italy or Romania is the legal successor state of imperial Austria or royal Hungary just because they got land from AH. And this is not about the borders, but about the statehood.  [[User:OrionNimrod|OrionNimrod]] ([[User talk:OrionNimrod|talk]]) 16:23, 23 November 2025 (UTC)\n*::Well it seems to me the case that: (1) having 2 unrecognised states as the so-called \"legal successor\" is incorrect and needs to be changed (2) having the actual legal successor states there might be a possibility albeit with a chronological gap. But the presentation of that complexity appropriately will be problematic. Complexity is not what Infoboxes are for.(3) Distinguishing between legal successors and territorial successors is very unusual in Infoboxes (most likely because of the types of complexity mentioned in 2). It begs the question why is this Infobox to be different to all the others? I propose it should just list the territorial successors or failing that have nothing in the parameter (which I know has been the solution where complexities have prevented easy agreement).

Any other flag is either a flag of only part of the empire, or purely naval in use.\n\nBut this is frequently used to represent the nationality of a person, e.g. in the infobox for [[World Chess Championship 1886]].

The Late Mediaeval Balkans, p. 379 (https://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472082605-ch7.pdf) - It doesn't mention battle in 1364.\n\nSo, why we make any connection between this battle and the battle of 1364 (I don't want to discuss here if that battle ever happened)? Why we make false references? I'm removing that statement about the revenge. --[[User:N Jordan|N Jordan]] ([[User talk:N Jordan|talk]]) 04:00, 27 September 2020 (UTC)\n\n== Some contradictions ==\n\nThere is a long tradition of presenting bias, nationalistic sympathies and misinterpretations, ahistorical notes and additions by later authors,  and outright nonsense when referring to this battle. This Wikipedia article complies well with this tradition. Most of the references are by authors who never visited the area and have very distorted information about the battle\u2019s whereabouts.   Let me address (some of) the issues point by point.\n\nThe goal of the Serbian army. The article has it\u2019s \u201cmake a surprise attack on the Ottomans in their capital city, Edirne, while Murad I was in Asia Minor.\u201d This is at odds with the size of the army. Surprise attacks are carried on with small mobile armies. Moreover, the fact that the Ottomans themselves surprised the Serbian army suggests that they had prior knowledge of the army\u2019s movements, which rules out the \u2018\u2019surprise\u2019\u2019 factor. If the intention was to capture Edrine, as the location of the battle highly suggests, this is again at odds with the size of the army and the date of the events. You do not need 50000-70000 men for a siege of a city. Late September is probably the strategically worst time to begin sieges, as crops are already harvested, the supplies are presumed to be already collected, and there are no issues with drought and heat. Simultaneously you bind much manpower, which is critically needed during field activities in a very active agricultural season.   If the intention was to get rid of the Ottomans from the Balkan peninsula then it is more logical to wait until Murad returns to perform a decisive blow against the whole Ottoman power, rather than look for temporary goals, which are likely to be avenged later on. It seems that the most likely goal was a preemptive blow, and some sources claim that Murad was planning a war either with Serbia or with Bulgaria at the time. \n\nThe route of the Serbian army. Contrary to what the map in the article (original unsourced work with purely speculative authenticity)  and John Fine claims, the domains of King Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 and his brother Despot Jovan Uglje\u0161a and the territories controlled by the Ottomans were not immediate neighbors. They were divided by the Rhodope mountains and the latter were never Serbian territories. Large armies are unlikely to pass through mountainous areas, especially if there was no rationale to do so.   This leaves essentially two routes that the Serbian army may have taken. The northern one, which is more likely, follows the ancient Via Militaris. It passes through Bulgarian territory and leaves open the problem of the Bulgarian involvement in the campaign. It is known that after their victory at Chernomen, the Turks immediately turned on Bulgaria. This is strange if the Bulgarians stayed uninvolved and the main Ottoman forces stayed in Asia Minor, but at least supports the \u2019\u2019northern route\u2019\u2019. The southern one follows the ancient Via Egnatia. This route requires passing through Byzantine territories, and at the time the relations between Byzantium and Serbia were hostile because of the Serbian schism.  Also, then it would have been strategically far more clever to pass the Marica river at a convenient downstream location.\n\nThe date of the battle. I do not know of a reliable contemporary source fixing the date on 26 September. It is notable that exactly 25 years later, on the same date, the massacre of the POWs at Nicopolis happened. There are more common traits with the Nicopolis battle (both battles happened near a river, in both cases the Turks appeared unexpectedly, both battles involved large Christian armies which were annihilated, and in both cases, the Christian army had a long passage before the events) which leaves open the problem of a possible bias. \n     \nThe exact location of the battle. I do not know of a reliable contemporary source fixing the location at Chernomen. I am not aware of any archeological studies confirming the location. Turkish sources place the battle at Sirp Sindigi, on the left bank of Marica. The left bank seems far more probable for a series of reasons. Most notably, the Serbian army tried to flee through the river. Had they been on the right bank near Chernomen, it is not logical for them to look for refuge on the right (Turkish) bank through a wide river such as Marica. Unless you are pushed to or encircled (the Turks lacked the manpower to do so), you do not tend to jump at night into an unknown wide and possibly deep river: https://www.google.pl/maps/@41.7730265,26.1921474,3a,75y,163.25h,84.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sYKXTdqXWrZnzqnQxSRpOiA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192\n The existence of a ford must have been known to the Serbs, who probably used it the previous day. \n\nThe sequence of events. According to http://astropixels.com/ephemeris/phasescat/phases1301.html\nOn 26 September 1371 it was almost full moon. Unless it was raining, it would have been a very bright night with very good visibility. The terrain is very flat. See yourself: https://www.google.pl/maps/@41.7072647,26.2424501,3a,75y,27.41h,86.41t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1svGi5Ev4iej9nYvuJoHUsTA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DvGi5Ev4iej9nYvuJoHUsTA%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D203.55655%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656\n Although I do not know anything about the forestation of the area, it seems that in such circumstances it is unlikely that significant forces would approach unnoticed.  It is unlikely that the Serbians did not set guards or reconnaissance, as the distance to Edrine is just 20-30 kilometers, so they were literally almost on the spot, well inside the Enemy territory. In my opinion, the only two possible explanations are an exhaustive passage through the river (there was no bridge at the location in the middle ages) earlier in the day, which supports the \u2018\u2019left bank\u2019\u2019 conjecture above, or a betrayal inside the Serbian camp.  The latter is probable, as the Turkish sources claim that the Serbians killed each other in the mess. \n\n,,After the battle, the Maritsa ran scarlet with blood\u2019\u2019. This does not happen as a result of drowning, stampede or killings that are not located immediately by the river bank. The only two possible explanations of the phenomenon (if it is not just literary fiction) are that either the Serbians fought each other for the limited places in boats or rafts, or there were massive executions of POWs at the river bank. Both suggest a possible bias with the battle of Nicopolis.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class=\"autosigned\">\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/31.182.220.23|31.182.220.23]] ([[User talk:31.182.220.23#top|talk]]) 02:22, 8 May 2022 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n== Sort of a summary ==\nMore than 17 years since the creation of the article, the same is practically a little one with content like from a children's fairy tale.\n\n[[Sitz im Leben]]!

A. Fine in The Late Medieval Balkans (1994, pp. 377\u2013378) writes that the Ottoman army was about 15,000 men, while the Serb army was much larger. Sima \u0106irkovi\u0107 in The Serbs (2004, pp. 66\u201367) also says the Ottomans sent around 15,000 men. Mark Bartusis in The Late Byzantine Army (1992, p. 415) gives similar context.\n:Right now the article uses the much smaller Ottoman number (the 800 vs 70,000 story), but that version seems to come from legendary or exaggerated later sources. Most modern historians treat those numbers as more of a myth or heroic tale rather than reality. Other editors on this talk page have also pointed out that the traditional numbers look unrealistic and may come from biased or nationalistic sources. Since at least two respected historians (Fine and \u0106irkovi\u0107) agree on the 15,000 figure, maybe we should update the article to reflect this more accurate estimate, while still mentioning the legendary version as part of the tradition.\n:What do you think?

We can say the same thing for pretty much any historical battle. Even in modern times it still happens and depends on which sources you consider to be more reliable. In this case we could create a new section on this page called \u2018\u2019strength of forces\u2019\u2019, so that we can mention all the estimates for the number of troops involved in the battle (and obviously their sources). However, we should not remove or completely change the numbers in the infobox. For now we have a estimate of 20,000 to 70,000 Serbian/Christian coalition troops and 800 to 4,000 Ottoman troops/cavalry. The Ottomans indeed could have sended 15,000 troops to the region, but how many of those were involved in the battle/raid itself? If we have even more clear sources for that, we could mention that in a new section (strength of forces). Then we could add that in the infobox as a third estimation as well.[[User:Woxic1589|Woxic1589]] ([[User talk:Woxic1589|talk]]) 13:30, 30 August 2025 (UTC)\n::::Yeah I agree with you, medieval battles almost always have overblown numbers, usually to make the story more dramatic.

You added the following: \u2018\u2019Turkish historian Abd\u00fclkadir \u00d6zcan notes that the information found in Ottoman sources claiming that \u015eahin Pa\u015fa and Hac\u0131 \u0130lbey defeated the large Christian army by a sudden raid on the banks of the Maritsa River is questionable.\u2019\u2019, but the source itself then confirms the entire Battle and its details as well (example: \u2018\u2019 he played an important role in the defeat of the joint Serbian forces at \u010cirmen (Maritsa) in 1371\u2019\u2019. What exactly is the questionable part about the Ottoman Sources here? That it happened during a sudden raid? The source itself doesn\u2019t explain any of it. So I\u2019m not sure if this should be added to the Battle section to begin with. [[User:Woxic1589|Woxic1589]] ([[User talk:Woxic1589|talk]]) 15:54, 13 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n:Hi @[[User:Woxic1589|Woxic1589]], thanks for reaching out here, happy to clarify. \u00d6zcan isn\u2019t questioning the existence of the Battle, what he calls \"\u015f\u00fcphelidir\" (doubtful) are the Ottoman accounts that describe the victory being achieved \"ani bir bask\u0131n sonucu\" (as a result of a sudden raid) by \u015eahin Pa\u015fa and Hac\u0131 \u0130lbey. In other words, he\u2019s flagging that the Ottoman source narrative of a surprise attack victory is doubtful, not that the battle itself didn\u2019t happen.\n:That sort of historiographical caution is standard practice and belongs in the article because it shows how modern scholarship treats the early Ottoman chronicles. It doesn\u2019t contradict the rest of the section, it just gives readers a more accurate picture of what \u00d6zcan, a Turkish historian and Ottomanist, actually says in TDV \u0130A.

If the common English name was \u201cSkadar\u201d, then the article on Wiki would not be called \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019. Furthermore, Fine first published the book in 1987 - how does that prove that \u2018Skadar\u2019 was the historical English name for Shkod\u00ebr in the 14th century? \n:English speaking authors have only come into contact with Shkod\u00ebr and other Albanian territories from the 19th century onwards (British naval officers, travellers etc from what I\u2019ve read), and they\u2019ve used multiple forms; Scutari, Skadar, and Shkodra, all adapted from non-English languages. I do not believe that the \u201chistorical name\u201d argument realistically applies here, considering that there is no proof that \u2018Skadar\u2019 is the historical English name; you cannot compare it to [[Cologne]], for example. As such, according to the policy I outlined in my edit, we are supposed to use the historical local name (Shkod\u00ebr).\n:Best.

[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LvVbRrH1QBgC&pg=PA379&dq=#v=onepage&q=Skadar&f=false See here] That establishes it as the historical English usage in modern scholarship and exactly what [[WP:PLACE]] refers to when it says: \"widely accepted historical English name\".\n::The article title Shkod\u00ebr reflects the modern toponym which is appropriate for a present day article but not for describing events of the 14th century. Per the guideline you outlined in your edit ([[WP:UEGN]]): \"If the place does not exist any more, or the article deals only with a place in a period when it held a different name, the widely accepted historical English name should be used\". Likewise, per [[WP:PLACE]], when an article deals with a specific historical context the historical English form used in reliable sources (\"Skadar\") should appear first, followed by the modern form in parentheses.\n::So the phrasing Skadar (modern Shkod\u00ebr) aligns with both wiki policy and the cited scholarship. -[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 12:48, 20 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::I don't see how you're coming to that conclusion regarding Fine and the historical-modern usage link.

English writers did not even mention Shkod\u00ebr at that time.\n:::WP:UEGN also states the following: {{tquote|If no name can be shown to be widely accepted in English, use the local name.

'Skadar' is used by Fine, who (again) is a single author. I can find you other authors who use Shkod\u00ebr/Scutari for the city when speaking about it in the Middle Ages or subsequent periods, but I don't think it would be all that necessary to do so over a word that appears a couple of times in the article.

It's difficult to find exclusively English sources (I have avoided Albanian or Serb authors writing in English, although I know many of them talk about Shkodra in the Middle Ages), and so regardless of the claims they're making, I'm just trying to see what the historical English name would be.

Upon first mention (and also in the index) I give the variant names for each place (e.g., Philippopolis [modern Plovdiv], or Durazzo [Dyrrachium, Durres], etc.).}}\n:::::Among the sources used for this article, we also have [https://research.sabanciuniv.edu/id/eprint/8505/1/3021800000030.pdf Aleksandar Shopov\u2019s MA thesis], The Historical Visions of the Battle of the Maritsa / Meri\u00e7 (Sabanc\u0131 University, Istanbul, 2006; supervisor: Yusuf Hakan Erdem). It\u2019s a 149-page academic study written entirely on this battle, making it the only work devoted exclusively to the topic (even though as an unpublished thesis it doesn\u2019t carry the same weight as a peer reviewed publication). Shopov is now a Harvard-trained PhD and Assistant Professor of Early Modern Ottoman History at SUNY Binghamton. On pp. 31\u201332 he writes:\n:::::{{tq|One of the documents from the archives in Dubrovnik (Ragusa) shows that in the early summer of 1371 Vuka\u0161in with his son Marko was in the vicinity of Skadar/Shkod\u00ebr preparing to attack the \u017eupan Nikola Altomanovi\u0107\u2026}}\n:::::Finally I\u2019d also like to offer one strong example that supports your argument. [https://archive.org/details/the-cambridge-history-of-the-byzantine-empire-c.-500-1492-2009 The Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire, c. 500\u20131492 (ed. Jonathan Shepard, Cambridge UP 2009)] which uses Shkod\u00ebr in its 14th century passages:\n:::::{{tq|p. 782: Stefan Du\u0161an (1331\u201355) required Latin priests from Shkod\u00ebr to pay their taxes to the Orthodox bishop of Prizren, a suffragan of Ohrid.}}\n:::::{{tq|p. 788: Relations with Serbia had been damaged by a Slav attack on Shkod\u00ebr after the collapse of the Venetian duchy of Durazzo, and these were now repaired.}}\n:::::Cambridge\u2019s index lists Skadar, Scodra, and Scutari as variants (p. 934). Taken together these examples show that modern English scholarship employs both Skadar and Shkod\u00ebr for this period, depending on author and context. \n:::::As a resolution I propose using \"Skadar (modern Shkod\u00ebr)\" in the article text where the sentence comes from Fine and \"Shkod\u00ebr\" in general prose or where it comes from Madgearu. This reflects Fine\u2019s historically grounded terminology, acknowledges Cambridge, Madgearu and Shopov on variant forms, and follows [[WP:UEGN]] and [[WP:PLACE]]. What do you think? -[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 09:41, 21 October 2025 (UTC)\n::::::I\u2019m glad you\u2019re willing to cooperate here, but I honestly don\u2019t see the point in using two different versions of the same name in a single article based on which author is being cited. If we did that everywhere, Wikipedia articles would be a mess.\n::::::I see the point in such an agreement for cities in which the name has substantially changed and the historical English name is quite established (e.g. [[Tenochtitlan]]/[[Mexico City]], [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]]), but that\u2019s not the case with Shkod\u00ebr from the 15th century until now. \n::::::Furthermore, it would seem there is still some debate on what the historical English term is. Specialist sources on the Battle of Maritsa (a Serbian-Ottoman battle) use \u2018Skadar\u2019, whereas sources discussing or touching on Shkod\u00ebr in the Middle Ages use \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019. Of course, the examples I provided above favour Shkod\u00ebr, but it would most likely be impossible to quantify exactly how many English sources use either term (or \u2018Scutari\u2019 for that matter) when discussing the city in the Middle Ages.\n::::::As such, I would argue that the safest and most logical thing to do would be to simply use the term that we already have on Wikipedia, which is [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. This is also the suggested route according to [[WP:UEGN]], when no historical English name can be identified with certainty. Of course, it\u2019s not all that important whether a town mentioned in passing on one article uses \u2018x\u2019 or \u2018y\u2019, but I feel as though this would set a precedent for other articles relating to Shkod\u00ebr in the Middle Ages, and so that is why I have been this insistent thus far. [[User:Botushali|Botushali]] ([[User talk:Botushali|talk]]) 13:10, 21 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::::Thanks @[[User:Botushali|Botushali]], I agree there\u2019s no need to turn this into a numbers exercise, which is why I didn\u2019t list every individual mention on Google Books. The point isn\u2019t how many sources use one form or another but how modern English-language scholarship treats the 1371 context.\n:::::::As demonstrated earlier, Fine uses Skadar over forty times throughout ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', including every reference to the 1371 campaign. That consistency in a major university press work makes it difficult to dismiss as a one off choice. Shopov (2006) uses Skadar/Shkod\u00ebr for the same event, while ''Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire'' (2009) and ''Madgearu'' (2008) use Shkod\u00ebr. So both forms clearly exist across respected modern sources.\n:::::::Using \"Skadar (modern Shkod\u00ebr)\" in the sentence that comes from Fine isn\u2019t an attempt to fragment the article but to reflect his wording accurately, per [[WP:V]], while keeping the rest of the text consistent with the modern form. That\u2019s a reasonable balance under [[WP:UEGN]] and [[WP:PLACE]] IMO.\n:::::::If there\u2019s still no clear consensus, I\u2019m ok to request a brief neutral comment at [[WP:3O]] so the issue can be settled fairly and we can move on. -[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 14:25, 21 October 2025 (UTC)\n::::::::I think a neutral comment request at WP:3O would be best at this point. Fine is a single author, and I have demonstrated above that other English-speaking authors have used \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 when discussing the town during the 14th century as well; whether they explicitly mention the 1371 campaign is not all that relevant if they use \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 when discussing an event that occurred only a few years prior to or after 1371. So therefore, if there is no consensus on the historical English name (which IMO seems to be Shkod\u00ebr), then as per [[WP:UEGN]], we are supposed to use the historical local name, which is \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019.\n::::::::Even if your reasoning, which is based on only a single source using \u2018Skadar\u2019 in the context of the Battle of Maritsa (even though you\u2019ve acknowledged that Shkod\u00ebr has also been used for the same event), prevails according to a neutral opinion, that should not be extended to other articles, as I have clearly demonstrated the use of \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 as the historical English name when discussing the town in the Middle Ages.\n::::::::Since we clearly won\u2019t reach a consensus, a neutral third opinion would help us conclude this discussion. If you\u2019re happy to post on WP:3O, I\u2019ll wait for another comment.

(Although there '''are''' quite a few good sources, such as ''War in Eleventh-Century Byzantium'', that use \"Skadar\", I usually seem to run into the problem of time-period in such cases.)\n:::::::::Cheers,\n:::::::::[[User:Himaldrmann|Himaldrmann]] ([[User talk:Himaldrmann|talk]]) 10:01, 23 October 2025 (UTC)\n::::::::::Hi @[[User:Himaldrmann|Himaldrmann]] thanks for looking into this.\n::::::::::To answer your question, the sources that use \"Shkod\u00ebr\" don\u2019t refer to the 1371 campaign or to the Principality of Zeta. The sentence in the article is about an army stationed in Zeta whose capital at the time was Skadar. Britannica and Fine both confirm this. Fine even introduces it as \"Skadar (Scutari, Shkoder, Scodra)\" (p. 51). Writing \"Skadar (modern Shkod\u00ebr)\" reflects that history and keeps the context clear for readers. Using only the modern Albanian form (or the older Illyrian, Latin or Ottoman names) would be inaccurate and confusing, since it implies the capital of Zeta already had that name, which it did not and which the cited source does not say. No newer high level RS shows otherwise. \u2013[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 16:19, 23 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::::::::Multiple sources have been given above that show \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 being used when referring to the town a few years prior, after, and including this time (not explicitly written just about 1371, but the period in general with the year included in that period). The same can probably be found for \u2018Scutari\u2019.\n:::::::::::With all due respect, Aeengath, you can\u2019t keep moving the goal posts just because you don\u2019t want the Albanian version, or another version for that matter. First you claimed that \u2018Skadar\u2019 was the most prevalent historical English name for the Middle Ages, so I brought sources to show that that\u2019s not really the case, and now you\u2019re arguing that sources don\u2019t refer to the campaign directly despite capturing the timeframe that the battle occurred in. Keep in mind, the sources I brought discuss the same time period, when Shkod\u00ebr was under the Balsha.\n:::::::::::You even acknowledged that authors also use \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 in the context of the Battle of Maritsa. Again, I have indicated above that \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 would seem to be more prevalent (at the minimum, it\u2019s just as prevalent) than \u2018Skadar\u2019, and \u2018Scutari\u2019 may perhaps be even more common than that, so really, \u2018Skadar\u2019 is out of the picture.\n:::::::::::{{tquote|Using only the modern Albanian form (or the older Illyrian, Latin or Ottoman names) would be inaccurate and confusing, since it implies the capital of Zeta already had that name\u2026}} The modern Albanian form was also in use in the Middle Ages by Albanians, who dominated the surrounding regions and perhaps Shkod\u00ebr itself demographically. Why wouldn\u2019t it have that name? The Balsha are thought of by many scholars as Albanians, and medieval sources refer to them as Albanian rulers, although of course some scholars think they may have a Slavic or Vlach origin.  Using that, or any other names that fit WP:UEGN (\u2018Skadar\u2019 does not) would not be confusing for readers; in fact, \u2018Skadar\u2019 would be more confusing. Nobody uses that nowadays, nor is it the common English term for the city during the Middle Ages, or 14th century as a whole (not just 1371, all of it under the Balsha, don\u2019t move the goal posts).

'''Skadar''' seems slightly more common than its Albanian rival in general historical (meaning ''about''\u2014mostly Byzantine, medieval, & Renaissance\u2014history) books or papers; and '''Shkod\u00ebr''' seems slightly more common than its Slavic nemesis in the more recent-ish books or papers about (very roughly) the specific time-period in question.  (So... uh... well, that may not have been very enlightening, heh.)\n:* Very often, I see something like ''\"[...] Scutari (Shkod\u00ebr) [...]\".''  This may or may not be relevant for Wiki purposes, but I thought I'd note that ''\"name (parenthetical variant)\"'' does have something of a pedigree.\n:* Looking at [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Skutari%2BScutari%2CSkadar%2CShkod%C3%ABr%2CShkodra&year_start=1922&year_end=2022&corpus=en Google Ngrams], it seems to affirm the general Anglish preference for '''Scutari;''' next-most-common, at least recently, appears to be ''Shkodra'' (...which I forgot to check for when doing the Unscientific Survey\u2122; whoops); ''Skadar'' and ''Shkod\u00ebr'' are neck-&-neck, and it's hard to glimpse much daylight between 'em.\n:* ''Scutari'' makes the others fade into oblivion, if one adjusts the temporal window to be a bit wider; removing it, we get [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Skadar%2CShkod%C3%ABr%2CShkodra&year_start=1822&year_end=2022&corpus=en this], wherein we can see that ''Shkodra'' is indeed a recent phenomenon, and\u2014historically\u2014'''Skadar''' appears to have the edge over ''Shkod\u00ebr''...\n:* ...but Ngrams doesn't limit itself to sources ''about'' history, so it is hard to know how much this popular preference for ''Scutari'' or ''Skadar'' is likely to be reflected therein.

I made a note that 'Scutari' should be considered in one of my initial comments above, as I have come across that form many times in the past, although I did not think to compare it to the other two alternatives. Although I don't think Google Ngrams can filter for sources that mention the 14th century in particular, I doubt there'd be much discrepancy? 'Scutari' would most likely prevail in that case, too. Even the 2023 'Historical Dictionary of Montenegro' uses 'Scutari' [https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Historical_Dictionary_of_Montenegro/BS2AEQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Scutari&pg=PA339&printsec=frontcover] when discussing the city before, during and after this time period. However, the 2022 'A Concise History of Albania' (one of the best modern books overviewing Albanian history) uses 'Shkod\u00ebr' for these same time periods. So honestly, I can't really tell, but what I do know is that Fine's book - which is the premise for using 'Skadar' - is almost four decades old, and 'Skadar' does not seem to trump 'Shkod\u00ebr' or 'Scutari' in English sources today when referring to the time period in question.\n::I want it known that I would accept whichever aligns best with the guideline, be it 'Shkod\u00ebr/Shkodra' (both are different tenses of the same name, Albanian grammatical thing), 'Scutari/Skutari' (the former is significantly more prevalent AFAIK) or 'Skadar', but I'm just not convinced that 'Skadar' beats either of the two as the historical English name for the 14th century. As you noted, 'Shkod\u00ebr/Shkodra' would seem to have become increasingly common in modern literature when discussing the time period in question, and of course, that should be taken into account if the other forms have fallen out of use, which is an important concept noted by Rosguill on their TP. I wouldn't mind 'Scutari (modern-day Shkod\u00ebr)' provided its the most common English historical name, but if we cannot say that with certainty, then the Wiki guideline we've all been looking at - [[WP:UEGN]] - clearly suggests that we use it's current name.\n:@[[User:Himaldrmann|Himaldrmann]], do you have a final concluding thought on this as a neutral third party? If you're convinced 'Scutari' is the more prevalent historical English name for this time period, then so be it; if you think that 'Shkod\u00ebr/Shkodra' (the former being the more grammatically correct form in terms of tense) has now become the most common historical English name, then that's fine as well. If you're still very uncertain, then [[WP:UEGN]] states {{tquote|... or the article deals only with a place in a period when it held a different name, the widely accepted historical English name should be used. If there is no such name in English, use the historical name that is now used locally...}} If no widely accepted historical English name can be established, then the guideline would favour the use of 'Shkod\u00ebr', no?\n::I have no qualms if what we conclude follows WP:UEGN appropriately, and it would be good to know so that we can set a precedent moving forward. In the past few months, I've begun working extensively on articles regarding Albania in the Middle Ages, so I'll most definitely need it as a reference for the future :) [[User:Botushali|Botushali]] ([[User talk:Botushali|talk]]) 11:21, 23 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n:::{{ping|Botushali|Aeengath|Himaldrmann}} I removed a longer comment that I posted soon after I posted it. I realized after re-reading it that it needed reworking and clarification, and maybe just should be shorter and more to the point. If I think it would be useful to add more than this comment, I will revise my previous post with the intention of adding to this comment later today or tomorrow. A main point of my comment is that in a modern source, Jacques, Tony. ''Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: A Guide to 8,500 Battles for Antiquity through the Twenty-first Century, Vol. 3'', P-Z Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2007. ISBN 978-0-313-33539-6, page 921, the author captions two later battles as Scutari and in the brief texts describes the battles as assaults \"against Scutari (modern Shkoder).\" The subject battle is listed in Volume 2 under the title Battle of Maritza (without a further explanation of its location.) I think Aeengath's and Hilmaldrmann's interpretations of the guidelines are generally correct and perhaps all the alternatives could be stated in some clear fashion (including perhaps, \"sometimes spelled as...\"). The question then becomes choosing the best way to comply with the guidelines and to provide as much useful and interesting information and identification of places and names (past and present) as possible to the readers without undue omissions or errors.

The only reason why I feel that this is so important is because it will set the precedent for all other related articles that discuss Shkod\u00ebr in the Middle Ages, so whatever is decided here will form the basis for how we go about naming things in those articles as well. I suppose my response should be dictated towards your remaining uncertainties:\n::::* {{tquote|Does the existence of a W.A.H.N. in English in other contexts trump the \"use local name\" clause triggered by the apparent lack of a W.A.H.N. for this particular context?...}} I think the existence of a W.A.H.N. for the 14th century would be heavily-tied to whatever the W.A.H.N. is for the \"neighbouring\" centuries as well. Considering many articles talk about the late 14th/early 15th century in tandem, for example, we can't switch from different forms for two sentences that happened with the same figures/polities but only a few years apart. IMO, it should remain consistent.\n::::* {{tquote|Does \"well, it was known as Skadar to the 14th-century Principality of Zeta\" have any standing, according to the guidelines...}} This is the core of Aeengath\u2019s argument, but as you also noticed, the guidelines don\u2019t say \u201cuse whatever the local ruling power called it at the time\u201d - they say \u201cuse the widely accepted historical English name.\u201d Fine deliberately chose 'Skadar' based on his methodology, but that doesn\u2019t automatically make it the English historical name. The fact that Cambridge, Madgearu, Norris, Kiel, and others use 'Shkod\u00ebr' for the same century shows that \u201cSkadar\u201d is not widely accepted in English, but rather one author\u2019s convention. The guidelines clearly don't support the use of 'Skadar', to this line of argumentation really shouldn't overtake policy in terms of importance.\n::::Furthermore, the Principality of Zeta wasn\u2019t a homogeneous South Slavic state. The ruling [[Balsha family]] is regarded by many scholars as having Albanian origins (see article). Much of the surrounding country was and remains Albanian-speaking: all of the regions neighbouring Shkod\u00ebr such as [[Zadrima]], [[Pult]], [[Mal\u00ebsia e Madhe]], and [[Ana e Malit]] are historically attested as having a dominant Albanian-majority; even in the [[Brda]] region farther north exist several tribes commonly treated in scholarship as of Albanian origin - [[Ku\u010di]], [[Vasojevi\u0107i]], [[Bratono\u017ei\u0107i]], [[Piperi]], [[Bjelopavli\u0107i]], all of which were still Albanian-speaking during the later Middle Ages. Other coastal/montane communities under Balsha influence, e.g. [[Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i]] and [[Malon\u0161i\u0107i]], had strong ethnic Albanian components as well, if not being entirely of Albanian origin. So while sources in the Maritsa context might use 'Skadar', it doesn\u2019t follow that the Principality of Zeta itself - which controlled all of these lands at some point in time in the 14th century - \u201cuniformly\u201d called it that, nor that 'Skadar' is the historically accepted English form for this era. \n::::As a follow-up to your note - {{tquote|... if @Botushali were to source his contention that Shkod\u00ebr was just as, or perhaps even more-so, used at the time, then that might be fairly decisive in favor of Shkod\u00ebr (by this standard)}} - I think I have indicated above that Shkod\u00ebr and its surrounding region consisted primarily of Albanians during this period of time; all of those articles can be checked for their sourced info, I suppose. Furthermore, from 'A Concise History of Albania' (2022) by Schmitt and Fischer, we have the following: {{tquote|Albanians encountered place-names on the Adriatic coast between 150 BC in the north (Ulcinj/Alb. Ulqin, It. Dulcigno, Shkod\u00ebr/Srb. Skadar/It. Scutari, Lezh\u00eb/lt. Alessio)...}} So Albanians, who formed the majority of Shkod\u00ebr and its surrounding regions in this period of time, were using 'Shkod\u00ebr' since at least 150 BC, which I think satisfies your query as to whether or not Shkod\u00ebr was the most commonly-used term at the time - if that's what you meant of course. Either way, I don't think that has any bearing on the guidelines, which should adjudicate the final result of this matter.\n::::In summary, [[User:Donner60|Donner60]] favours 'Scutari (modern day Shkod\u00ebr)', Aeengath favours 'Skadar (modern day Shkod\u00ebr)', and I favour 'Shkod\u00ebr', but I would not mind swapping to 'Scutari (modern day Shkod\u00ebr)' if you, [[User:Himaldrmann|Himaldrmann]], were to support that over 'Shkod\u00ebr', although we simply cannot justify using 'Skadar' according to the given guidelines. So I suppose, with the scores even, it's ultimately up to you. This way, we can finally reach a consensus and put this conversation to rest.\n::::Whatever the case, I think a reasonable fallback would be to include a short explanatory footnote, as Donner suggested, listing all the principal historical forms of the name (Skadar, Scutari, Shkodra, etc.) alongside the modern Shkod\u00ebr - or, if we swing to Scutari, then Scutari (modern day Shkod\u00ebr). That way, readers are fully informed of the variants, we stay consistent with [[WP:UEGN]]/[[WP:PLACE]], and we avoid setting a confusing precedent of name-switching between different articles.

''Britannica (2002)'' describes {{tq|Zeta (...) with its capital at Skadar}} and ''Roberts'' (''2007, Realm of the Black Mountain, p. 8'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QKslEQAAQBAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&printsec=frontcover&dq=Realm+of+the+Black+Mountain&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=then%20known%20as%20Skadar%20(later%20Scutari%2C%20then%20Shkodra)&f=false]) confirm the city was {{tq|then known as Skadar (later Scutari, then Shkodra)}}, clearly showing the chronological progression.\n::::In short, none of these ''Shkod\u00ebr'' sources describe the specific military movement in question: the Zetan army assembling in ''Skadar'' before the Battle of Maritsa.\n::::\u00b9Per [[WP:THESIS]] ''Shopov (2006)'', a 149-page MA thesis supervised by Ottoman historian Yusuf Hakan Erdem, remains the only full-length English study of the Battle of Maritsa. Its findings on Skadar/Shkod\u00ebr align fully with ''Fine (1994)''.\n::::* ''On accuracy and policy'': since the cited source (''Fine 1994, p. 379'') literally use ''Skadar'', substituting another name would detach the text from its citation and contradict [[WP:V]] and [[WP:TSI]]. ''Scutari'' is not the name used in the cited source and only appears a few decades later during the Venetian period, hence its use in ''Tony Jaques (2007)''. Using it here would risk a mild anachronism and synthesis under [[WP:OR]].\n::::* ''On historical consistency'': as ''Truhart'' (''1984, p. 3322''[https://archive.org/details/regentsofnations0001truh/page/3322/mode/2up?q=%22skadar+zeta%22]) records ''Skadar/Zeta'' was the seat of rule under the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty from the late twelfth century until 1371. When ''Fine'' writes that {{tq|Vuka\u0161in and his son Marko in the summer of 1371 marched west to Zeta (...) they were all together in Skadar preparing for action}} that phrasing matches both the history and the way the period is described in English scholarship.\n::::For that reason, I believe the policy verifiable and historically precise form is '''Skadar (modern Shkod\u00ebr)''', keeping the sentence aligned with its source and avoiding anachronism. If consensus lands on '''Scutari (modern Shkod\u00ebr)''' for broader consistency as proposed by [[User:Donner60|Donner60]], that\u2019s fine too, as long as we add a short footnote clarifying that ''Scutari'' only became current later under Venetian rule.\n::::-[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 20:57, 26 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::No problem, amigo!

With any luck, we won't run across too many of these situations. [[User:Donner60|Donner60]] ([[User talk:Donner60|talk]]) 01:47, 27 October 2025 (UTC)\n::::::::OK, so we all agree on a footnote listing the historical variants - that seems like the most constructive compromise and ensures readers get the full picture.\n::::::::That said, I do want to address [[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]]\u2019s repeated reframing that sources discussing the Battle of Maritsa use 'Skadar'. The Battle of Maritsa was a conflict between the Serbs and the Ottomans in what is today Greece, and Shkod\u00ebr is mentioned only in passing. A source passingly mentioning 'Skadar' in reference to Maritsa hardly makes it the \u201chistorical English name\u201d for Shkod\u00ebr in the 14th century. By that logic, if one event uses a certain spelling and another event a few years later uses a different spelling, we would constantly switch names mid-article depending on the author. Imagine how inconsistent and unreadable articles would look if we actually followed that standard. That\u2019s exactly why [[WP:UEGN]] exists - to avoid that kind of arbitrary inconsistency. One term should be used for ''all'' articles.\n::::::::Also, I think we should be cautious about leaning so heavily on Encyclopedia Britannica. Per [[WP:BRITANNICA]], Britannica is a [[WP:TERTIARY]] source. It\u2019s fine to consult, but it doesn\u2019t override broader policy or the weight of usage in modern scholarship. And while Aeengath cites Britannica to support 'Skadar', the article they cited doesn\u2019t explicitly connect their usage of 'Skadar' to Maritsa either - it\u2019s just being highlighted because it aligns with Aeengath's preferred spelling, despite going against the same line of argumentation they keep using.\n::::::::So with the footnote agreed on, we now need to finally decide the main form to use. [[User:Himaldrmann|Himaldrmann]] has indicated support for 'Shkod\u00ebr' (which makes two of us). Aeengath worries that 'Scutari' is anachronistic, but would accept it in order to avoid the Albanian spelling. 'Skadar' is simply not acceptable under the guidelines, as we've established. My preference remains 'Shkod\u00ebr', especially since, as Aeengath pointed out, 'Scutari' is more Venetian and came into use after the Balshas handed the town over to the Republic of Venice in 1396. But, I'm sure sources exist that use 'Scutari' in a 14th-century context. Due to the complexity of the matter, the easiest and least-confusing way to go about this IMO would be to just use '[[Shkod\u00ebr]]', which is the Wiki article's current title, and be done with it. [[WP:UEGN]] clearly states that if no W.A.H.N. exists, we should use the modern local name. If there's no more objections, I'd be happy to insert the footnote on the end of 'Shkod\u00ebr'.

You can\u2019t keep moving the goalposts. I\u2019m happy to agree to a consensus, but not if \u2018Skadar\u2019 keeps getting snuck in as though it has some sort of prominence over the term \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019. \n::::::::::You use the word \u201cchronological\u201d very loosely - \u2018Shkod\u00ebr/Shkodra\u2019 predates the other two terms by many centuries, as confirmed by the quote I used much earlier by Schmitt and Fischer. In fact, the Albanian form \u2018Shkodra\u2019 even predates the arrival of Slavs in the Balkans. So, if we\u2019re going to be ''chronological'' in the footnote here (which is IMO stupid and not called for by guidelines in any way), \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 predates all forms, save for Skodra/Scodra in antiquity. \n::::::::::What I mean by \u201cin passing\u201d, is that when Shkodra is mentioned in the sources that discuss the Battle of Maritsa, it is mentioned passingly with no real prominence in the actual turn of events. The battle was nowhere near Shkod\u00ebr, and its only relevance was that Vuka\u0161in marched from there when summoned by his brother. Not with an army of Shkodrans, either. \n::::::::::As I said, if every article differed in the name it used for events that happened only a few years apart with the same exact polities and characters, Wikipedia articles would be confusing. If x source mentions an event and uses y name, that doesn\u2019t make it the historical English name. If we wrote articles exclusively according to the name which each cited source uses for its corresponding line, you might end up with three or four renditions of the same name in the same article. That\u2019s why we have [[WP:UEGN]], so I\u2019m not sure why you keep arguing for something that is not policy-based in the slightest. Quoting [[WP:V]] and then drawing abstractions from it is quite pointless when we have a policy for this exact issue. If we use \u2018Skadar\u2019 here (which we shouldn\u2019t), it would need to be used on all relevant articles that fall within a similar timeframe, even though \u2018Shkodra\u2019 and \u2018Scutari\u2019 are used as well. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so firm on not letting it go\u2026 [[User:Botushali|Botushali]] ([[User talk:Botushali|talk]]) 14:39, 27 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::::::::I agree with Aeengath that the additional sources that she has discovered justifies the use of Skadar in this article. And she is willing to compromise on how it would be used.\n:::::::::::Based in Botushali's last comment, however, it appears that this cannot be settled by consensus of the three others commenting plus Botushali, since that editor \"won't let go\" of his view that no mention of alternatives should be made. Other comments, perhaps by military history project coordinators or experienced users may need to be sought. Perhaps more likely, it may need to be taken to higher level of dispute resolution. \n:::::::::::I am not persuaded that the mere mention of Skadar under these circumstances is wrong nor do I foresee some sort of confusion or bad consequences in other articles if the use and time frames of the alternative names for the location are are properly explained. I don't agree that an interpretation of the guidelines to exclude even mention of any alternative or historically different names over time is required when the main or title names and locations for the battle are chosen. I think it would be helpful, rather than confusing, to add a footnote (or even in the text) with all the names over time in this case and in others that may be similar - again, as long as the article title and appropriate names for the battle and location at the time are in line with the guidelines. If the consensus of others or a persuasive interpretation can be shown to be different, I would stand corrected, of course. \n:::::::::::The mention of different names for locations of battles and changes of name over time for those locations is not unprecedented in Wikipedia and does not add to confusion or undue length. Different names for the same event, much less different for events years apart, appear to be rather common. \n:::::::::::From the lead: \"The '''Battle of Kemp's Landing''', also known as the '''Skirmish of Kempsville''', was a [[skirmish]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]] that occurred on November 15, 1775.\" From the end of the article: \"Kemp's Landing incorporated in 1778 as [[Kempsville, Virginia|Kempsville]], and became the county seat for [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]].

I think there may be some confusion about my last comment, so let me restate clearly:\n::::::::::::I have never said that \u2018Skadar\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be mentioned at all. My point was that if we went down the \u201cchronological order\u201d path for the footnote (which I don\u2019t support, since the guidelines don\u2019t call for it), then the order would not be what Aeengath suggested \u2014 because \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 predates both \u2018Skadar\u2019 and \u2018Scutari\u2019, as shown by Schmitt & Fischer (2022). What I have consistently said is that I\u2019m fine with \u2018Scutari (modern Shkod\u00ebr)\u2019 if consensus swings that way as a compromise, as long as the footnote is attached listing all common historical variants without giving prominence to one over the other, because that\u2019s not what sources do. We probably don\u2019t even need \u2018(modern Shkod\u00ebr)\u2019 if we hyperlink Scutari and add the footnote immediately after listing all variants.\n::::::::::::As for sources, I\u2019ve already listed several that use Shkod\u00ebr for the exact same time frame, and I\u2019m sure I could find more \u2014 Kiel (1990), Norris (1993), Swire (1937), Madgearu (2008), Cambridge History (2009). Aeengath\u2019s response that \u201cthose don\u2019t describe Maritsa\u201d misses the point, and ironically, neither do all of the sources they just listed. Britannica and Roberts are broad histories that don\u2019t even talk about Maritsa when mentioning Shkod\u00ebr, Truhart is a reference catalogue, and Shopov is an MA thesis (widely-cited though) that uses Skadar/Shkod\u00ebr interchangeably. The fact remains: there is no single \u201cwidely accepted historical English name\u201d across the scholarship. Some say Skadar, some Shkod\u00ebr, some Scutari.\n::::::::::::That is exactly why WP:UEGN exists - to avoid chopping up articles line by line based on whatever spelling each individual author prefers. If we followed Aeengath\u2019s logic, an article might use three different spellings for the same city within the same few decades depending on the source cited, which would be chaotic. It is also strange to have different articles use different spelling for the same timeframe, which is another reason why WP:UEGN exists. Policy resolves this by saying: if there is no widely accepted historical English name, use the local one. That means Shkod\u00ebr, but I\u2019ve already agreed to compromise on \u2018Scutari\u2019 with a footnote, just because it might be more prevalent for the Middle Ages.\n::::::::::::For clarity and consistency across articles, the best policy-compliant solution is IMO: main text = Shkod\u00ebr, with a footnote listing the other forms (Skadar, Scutari, Shkodra, whatever else). That way we stay aligned with guidelines, we respect all the sources, and we give readers the full picture without turning the article into a patchwork of competing spellings. But, failing that, I would agree to \u2018Scutari\u2019 with a footnote doing the same. \n::::::::::::Finally, [[User:Donner60|Donner60]], I don\u2019t think the American Revolutionary War and Civil War examples you cite are actually comparable here. Those cases involve places whose names changed later under the same line of polities (e.g. towns incorporated, merged, or renamed) and editors noting both the old and new forms. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re dealing with in Shkod\u00ebr. Shkod\u00ebr was not some later invention or renaming; it was already the native/local form in use during the 14th century, alongside the other variants. The situation is different because we\u2019re not choosing between a former name that disappeared and a modern name that replaced it - we\u2019re choosing between several co-existing exonyms, none of which is the \u201cwidely accepted historical English name\u201d. That is exactly the scenario WP:UEGN was written for, and it points us clearly toward the local name. \n::::::::::::I think an RfC would be a bit too much, the reason why it\u2019s dragged out is because, realistically, the form used here should be used on corresponding articles. So, in a way, it\u2019s deciding those articles too. If we really want to make a special exception where only one article on Wiki uses \u2018Skadar\u2019 for the Middle Ages, sure I guess, but I would hope such usage wouldn\u2019t spread to similar articles, because this whole debate will have to be repeated again and again... [[User:Botushali|Botushali]] ([[User talk:Botushali|talk]]) 03:50, 28 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::::::::::This begins to seem like everyone is favoring the same general solution for naming all the locations in this article by mentioning them all in one way or another. Perhaps we are talking past each other to some extent. It also seems that I misunderstood your comment that you were against the footnote proposal insofar as it would continue to include Skadar. I am not opposed to your proposal and definitely favor Scutari for the main text with other mentions being in a footnote. The naming in relevant sources should govern. \n:::::::::::::My thought o precent is that this situation, because of few and conflicting sources, and different times of other articles, isn't necessarily a precedent for other articles. You do seem to be limiting this to the Middle Ages in this area. I presume that would not be a large number of articles, which considerably excludes or narrows the possible disagreements with respect to the far larger number of military history articles overall. In this case, I think that there are enough sources to support mention of all the possible names here. I presume that might not always be true or if properly presented, verified by sources and explained, would not pose much problem.\n:::::::::::::So we may not be pointing to a higher or more complicated dispute resolution procedure, which would be a good thing on which I think we can all agree. \n:::::::::::::I would also be remiss not to thank you for your extensive work in improving these articles.

His thesis has since been used by Stephen W.

I have not checked to see if it says anything about Maritsa, but  the entire journal articles uses \u2018Shkodra\u2019, and only mentions \u2018Skadar\u2019 once at the beginning: {{tquote|\u2026 between the residents of Shkodra (Skadar in Slav.) \u2026}} So although it acknowledges \u2018Skadar\u2019, as we have all agreed to do so under a footnote here, the preferred name for this time period (1371 included) is Shkod\u00ebr/Shkodra.\n:::* Premovi\u0107, Temizer & Stankovi\u0107, \u2018Zeta Under the Bal\u0161i\u0107 Dynasty and the Ottoman Empire (1385\u20131421)\u2019 (2024) [https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=1288056] - Although the article focuses on 1385 onwards (only 14 years after Maritsa), it does say the following: {{tquote|The Bal\u0161i\u0107 brothers Stracimir, \u0110ura\u0111 I, and Bal\u0161a II ruled Zeta from 1360 to 1421. At the beginning of their rule, their domain included a narrow strip of land between Skadar Lake and the sea, the cities of Bar, and Shkodra.}} So, from 1360 (1371 included) onwards, they prefer the exclusive use of \u2018Shkodra\u2019. This article also talks about the Battle of Maritsa soon after in that same passage.\n:::* Molina, \u2018A Model to Decode Venetian Senate Deliberations: Pregadi \u201cTalk\u201d on Albanian Territories (1392\u20131402)\u2019 (2020) - this PhD dissertation, which has been cited elsewhere in bibliography, uses only \u2018Shkodra\u2019. It also talks about events before 1392, including Maritsa.\n:::* Zachariadou, \u2018Marginalia on the History of Epirus and Albania (1380\u20141418)\u2019 (1988) - mentions Maritsa at the beginning, but this article uses \u2018Scutari\u2019 as the preferred form.\n:::Evidently, \u2018Skadar\u2019 is not the W.A.H.N. for any part of the 14th century, not even 1371. [[User:Botushali|Botushali]] ([[User talk:Botushali|talk]]) 22:42, 28 October 2025 (UTC)\n::::@[[User:Botushali|Botushali]] Thanks for those but none seem directly relevant, they\u2019re broader or later studies and don\u2019t describe the 1371 staging itself.\n::::Premovi\u0107 & Giakoumis (2023) cover trade networks (1358\u20131396) not the campaign; the line you quoted even says \"Skadar (in Slav.)\", confirming the accepted historical name. Using Shkodra elsewhere in a wide economic study is just modernisation for readability, not evidence of a W.A.H.N.\n::::Premovi\u0107 et al. (2024) starts in 1385, Molina (2020) focuses on 1392\u20131402 Venice and Zachariadou (1988) covers 1380\u20131418 under Venetian rule so all well after the event in question, when Zeta was no longer independent, the city was under different rule and linguistic influences, and known under a different name.\n::::Broader regional works often use a single modern form across long periods for convenience, but event-specific scholarship uses the form current in the period described, that's what specific historical context is about.\n::::You wrote that {{tq|'''A W.A.H.N. doesn\u2019t exist for only a single year in history before swapping over to something else for the time before and the time after.'''}} In practice, that\u2019s exactly how [[WP:PLACE]] handles historical naming when context changes. \n::::It\u2019s the same principle used elsewhere on Wikipedia: when describing events in Saint Petersburg, historians write Petrograd for the [[February Revolution]] and Leningrad for the [[Siege of Leningrad|1941\u20131944 Siege]], each reflecting the name used at that specific time. Likewise, the 1371 staging described by Fine and Shopov took place when the city was known as Skadar within the Principality of Zeta; the Venetian Scutari and Albanian Shkod\u00ebr forms belong to different periods and can be listed in a note for clarity as suggested by @[[User:Donner60|Donner60]].\n::::Given that none of the sources cited cover Zeta or the 1371 campaign directly, they don\u2019t establish a different W.A.H.N. for this context. \n::::-[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 10:04, 29 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]], with respect, your argument leans far too heavily on [[WP:CHERRYPICK|cherry-picking]] two sources that describe one very narrow campaign only slightly linked to Shkod\u00ebr, and then inflating those into a claim about the \u201caccepted historical name\u201d for the entire period. That\u2019s not how [[WP:UEGN]] works, as I\u2019ve had to say over and over and over again. A W.A.H.N. isn\u2019t determined by whether a single historian opts for \u2018Skadar\u2019 in one event narrative; rather, it\u2019s determined by broader scholarly usage across the timeframe in question. \n:::::That\u2019s why I cited Premovi\u0107, Molina, Zachariadou, and others before that - not because they narrate Maritsa at great depth itself (although they do mention it), but because they show that in the same chronological window (before, during, and after 1371), the preference across wider scholarship is for Shkod\u00ebr (or Scutari). Premovi\u0107 and Giakoumis even make a point of saying {{tquote|\u2026 between the residents of Shkodra (Skadar in Slav.) \u2026}}, mentioning \u2018Skadar\u2019 only once as the term in ''Slavic'' (not as the historical English name), before reverting exclusively to Shkodra throughout the study. That\u2019s an acknowledgment of a variant, not a declaration that it was the accepted name. To spin it otherwise is misleading, and your selective framing and misquoting of that sentence goes against [[WP:V]], which you insist on using inappropriately.\n:::::The idea that [[WP:V]] or [[WP:PLACE]] require us to replicate whatever spelling one author happens to use for one sentence is simply not what policy dictates. What policy ''does'' dictate is that, when no single W.A.H.N. exists, use the local name. That\u2019s Shkod\u00ebr. The compromise on \u2018Scutari\u2019 with a footnote listing variants already respected that balance and could have closed this discussion some time ago.\n:::::Insisting instead on elevating \u2018Skadar\u2019 based on two selective references isn\u2019t policy-driven, it\u2019s cherry-picking. It doesn\u2019t outweigh the wider literature, and it certainly doesn\u2019t override the naming guideline that applies here, as I\u2019ve had to repeatedly state an untold number of times to the point where it\u2019s just getting ridiculous. Also, the Petrograd/Leningrad analogy doesn\u2019t apply. It\u2019s a false comparison. Those were official state-imposed name changes with hard start and end dates that are reflected in sources on their respective eras. Shkod\u00ebr was never \u201crenamed\u201d to \u2018Skadar\u2019 in that sense, because these are parallel exonyms that coexisted in the literature, and the usage of \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 predates \u2018Skadar\u2019 by more than roughly five centuries as cited above to Schmitt and Fischer\u2026\n:::::At this point, I honestly don\u2019t know if your comments are AI-generated or something, because you keep missing the core point that\u2019s been re-stated over and over again and recycling the same misread of policy as though repetition makes it true. We were close to resolving this with consensus around \u2018Scutari\u2019 + footnote, but you\u2019re dragging this out by pushing a form that has clearly not been shown to be the W.A.H.N. This is why the discussion keeps going in circles, and it\u2019s like talking to a brick wall. \n:::::We\u2019ve all wasted considerable time on this matter. If @[[User:Donner60|Donner60]] and @[[User:Himaldrmann|Himaldrmann]] are still in agreement with \u2018Scutari\u2019 + footnote, then I will make the appropriate change because that would be the general consensus here. Although just because you\u2019re pushing for \u2018Skadar\u2019 with no compromise, we should honestly stick exactly to what [[WP:UEGN]] says and go for \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019, the local name, but I wouldn\u2019t want to waste anyone\u2019s time any further.

I'll repeat: I think we agree on the guideline but the question is what do the sources support and how should it be applied here. We have a limited number of sources and they appear to differ. So I think the proposed compromise is the best we can do in this case without dragging it on. If all the place names are mentioned and explained, that should achieve the result of giving readers all of the possibly relevant information and make the article a little easier to find for readers who might be looking for one of the alternatives.<br>\n::::::I will note that we have not been discussing the actual name of the battle.

I may have missed something along the way but I think it is best (for me and probably for each of you) to end this as this discussion now stands, even if the result may not be ideal from all perspectives.<br>\n::::::I agree that spending more time on this would take away time during which you can make more meaningful contributions to Wikipedia - and I can get back to some backlogged reviews. I think little more is likely to result from spending more time on it. It is up to each of you as to whether you think that other opinions should be sought or whether this needs to be resolved by a wider group or a higher level. I do think we are in position to accept a consensus among ourselves. Perhaps a future discussion on the precise topic at issue might even come in a future and clearer case than this one - rather than in this one.

Shopov\u2019s findings on the battle have been cited in later academic publications, [[Talk:Battle_of_Maritsa#c-Aeengath-20251027171500-Himaldrmann-20251023100100|as recent as 2024]]. \n::::::<u>No newer or event-specific English sources have been found that use a different name.</u>\n::::::As [[User:Rosguill]] explained [[User_talk:Rosguill#WP:UEGN|on his TP]], '''\"being specific to the actual context you\u2019re writing about is typically the way to go on Wikipedia, which would favour the Battle of Maritsa sources.\"'''  \n::::::The other works cited discuss later or broader contexts, under different rule and use the names current in those periods (like ''Scutari'').

The form ''Scutari'' became current later under Venetian rule (1396\u20131479), while the modern Albanian name is ''Shkod\u00ebr''. See ''Roberts, Realm of the Black Mountain (Hurst, 2007)'', p. 8 (\"then known as Skadar (later Scutari, then Shkodra)\"), and ''Encyclopaedia Britannica (2002)'' on Zeta, \"with its capital at Skadar.\"</small>\n::::::----\n::::::At this point we should wait for @[[User:Himaldrmann|Himaldrmann]] to review and close this 3O since he opened it.

Why we make false references? I'm removing that statement about the revenge. --[[User:N Jordan|N Jordan]] ([[User talk:N Jordan|talk]]) 04:00, 27 September 2020 (UTC)\n\n== Some contradictions ==\n\nThere is a long tradition of presenting bias, nationalistic sympathies and misinterpretations, ahistorical notes and additions by later authors,  and outright nonsense when referring to this battle. This Wikipedia article complies well with this tradition. Most of the references are by authors who never visited the area and have very distorted information about the battle\u2019s whereabouts.   Let me address (some of) the issues point by point.\n\nThe goal of the Serbian army. The article has it\u2019s \u201cmake a surprise attack on the Ottomans in their capital city, Edirne, while Murad I was in Asia Minor.\u201d This is at odds with the size of the army. Surprise attacks are carried on with small mobile armies. Moreover, the fact that the Ottomans themselves surprised the Serbian army suggests that they had prior knowledge of the army\u2019s movements, which rules out the \u2018\u2019surprise\u2019\u2019 factor. If the intention was to capture Edrine, as the location of the battle highly suggests, this is again at odds with the size of the army and the date of the events. You do not need 50000-70000 men for a siege of a city. Late September is probably the strategically worst time to begin sieges, as crops are already harvested, the supplies are presumed to be already collected, and there are no issues with drought and heat. Simultaneously you bind much manpower, which is critically needed during field activities in a very active agricultural season.   If the intention was to get rid of the Ottomans from the Balkan peninsula then it is more logical to wait until Murad returns to perform a decisive blow against the whole Ottoman power, rather than look for temporary goals, which are likely to be avenged later on. It seems that the most likely goal was a preemptive blow, and some sources claim that Murad was planning a war either with Serbia or with Bulgaria at the time. \n\nThe route of the Serbian army. Contrary to what the map in the article (original unsourced work with purely speculative authenticity)  and John Fine claims, the domains of King Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 and his brother Despot Jovan Uglje\u0161a and the territories controlled by the Ottomans were not immediate neighbors. They were divided by the Rhodope mountains and the latter were never Serbian territories. Large armies are unlikely to pass through mountainous areas, especially if there was no rationale to do so.   This leaves essentially two routes that the Serbian army may have taken. The northern one, which is more likely, follows the ancient Via Militaris. It passes through Bulgarian territory and leaves open the problem of the Bulgarian involvement in the campaign. It is known that after their victory at Chernomen, the Turks immediately turned on Bulgaria. This is strange if the Bulgarians stayed uninvolved and the main Ottoman forces stayed in Asia Minor, but at least supports the \u2019\u2019northern route\u2019\u2019. The southern one follows the ancient Via Egnatia. This route requires passing through Byzantine territories, and at the time the relations between Byzantium and Serbia were hostile because of the Serbian schism.  Also, then it would have been strategically far more clever to pass the Marica river at a convenient downstream location.\n\nThe date of the battle. I do not know of a reliable contemporary source fixing the date on 26 September. It is notable that exactly 25 years later, on the same date, the massacre of the POWs at Nicopolis happened. There are more common traits with the Nicopolis battle (both battles happened near a river, in both cases the Turks appeared unexpectedly, both battles involved large Christian armies which were annihilated, and in both cases, the Christian army had a long passage before the events) which leaves open the problem of a possible bias. \n     \nThe exact location of the battle. I do not know of a reliable contemporary source fixing the location at Chernomen. I am not aware of any archeological studies confirming the location. Turkish sources place the battle at Sirp Sindigi, on the left bank of Marica. The left bank seems far more probable for a series of reasons. Most notably, the Serbian army tried to flee through the river. Had they been on the right bank near Chernomen, it is not logical for them to look for refuge on the right (Turkish) bank through a wide river such as Marica. Unless you are pushed to or encircled (the Turks lacked the manpower to do so), you do not tend to jump at night into an unknown wide and possibly deep river: https://www.google.pl/maps/@41.7730265,26.1921474,3a,75y,163.25h,84.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sYKXTdqXWrZnzqnQxSRpOiA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192\n The existence of a ford must have been known to the Serbs, who probably used it the previous day. \n\nThe sequence of events. According to http://astropixels.com/ephemeris/phasescat/phases1301.html\nOn 26 September 1371 it was almost full moon. Unless it was raining, it would have been a very bright night with very good visibility. The terrain is very flat.

It is unlikely that the Serbians did not set guards or reconnaissance, as the distance to Edrine is just 20-30 kilometers, so they were literally almost on the spot, well inside the Enemy territory. In my opinion, the only two possible explanations are an exhaustive passage through the river (there was no bridge at the location in the middle ages) earlier in the day, which supports the \u2018\u2019left bank\u2019\u2019 conjecture above, or a betrayal inside the Serbian camp.  The latter is probable, as the Turkish sources claim that the Serbians killed each other in the mess. \n\n,,After the battle, the Maritsa ran scarlet with blood\u2019\u2019. This does not happen as a result of drowning, stampede or killings that are not located immediately by the river bank. The only two possible explanations of the phenomenon (if it is not just literary fiction) are that either the Serbians fought each other for the limited places in boats or rafts, or there were massive executions of POWs at the river bank. Both suggest a possible bias with the battle of Nicopolis.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class=\"autosigned\">\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/31.182.220.23|31.182.220.23]] ([[User talk:31.182.220.23#top|talk]]) 02:22, 8 May 2022 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n== Sort of a summary ==\nMore than 17 years since the creation of the article, the same is practically a little one with content like from a children's fairy tale.\n\n[[Sitz im Leben]]!

A. Fine in The Late Medieval Balkans (1994, pp. 377\u2013378) writes that the Ottoman army was about 15,000 men, while the Serb army was much larger. Sima \u0106irkovi\u0107 in The Serbs (2004, pp. 66\u201367) also says the Ottomans sent around 15,000 men. Mark Bartusis in The Late Byzantine Army (1992, p. 415) gives similar context.\n:Right now the article uses the much smaller Ottoman number (the 800 vs 70,000 story), but that version seems to come from legendary or exaggerated later sources. Most modern historians treat those numbers as more of a myth or heroic tale rather than reality. Other editors on this talk page have also pointed out that the traditional numbers look unrealistic and may come from biased or nationalistic sources. Since at least two respected historians (Fine and \u0106irkovi\u0107) agree on the 15,000 figure, maybe we should update the article to reflect this more accurate estimate, while still mentioning the legendary version as part of the tradition.\n:What do you think?

We can say the same thing for pretty much any historical battle. Even in modern times it still happens and depends on which sources you consider to be more reliable. In this case we could create a new section on this page called \u2018\u2019strength of forces\u2019\u2019, so that we can mention all the estimates for the number of troops involved in the battle (and obviously their sources). However, we should not remove or completely change the numbers in the infobox. For now we have a estimate of 20,000 to 70,000 Serbian/Christian coalition troops and 800 to 4,000 Ottoman troops/cavalry. The Ottomans indeed could have sended 15,000 troops to the region, but how many of those were involved in the battle/raid itself? If we have even more clear sources for that, we could mention that in a new section (strength of forces).

You added the following: \u2018\u2019Turkish historian Abd\u00fclkadir \u00d6zcan notes that the information found in Ottoman sources claiming that \u015eahin Pa\u015fa and Hac\u0131 \u0130lbey defeated the large Christian army by a sudden raid on the banks of the Maritsa River is questionable.\u2019\u2019, but the source itself then confirms the entire Battle and its details as well (example: \u2018\u2019 he played an important role in the defeat of the joint Serbian forces at \u010cirmen (Maritsa) in 1371\u2019\u2019. What exactly is the questionable part about the Ottoman Sources here? That it happened during a sudden raid? The source itself doesn\u2019t explain any of it. So I\u2019m not sure if this should be added to the Battle section to begin with. [[User:Woxic1589|Woxic1589]] ([[User talk:Woxic1589|talk]]) 15:54, 13 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n:Hi @[[User:Woxic1589|Woxic1589]], thanks for reaching out here, happy to clarify. \u00d6zcan isn\u2019t questioning the existence of the Battle, what he calls \"\u015f\u00fcphelidir\" (doubtful) are the Ottoman accounts that describe the victory being achieved \"ani bir bask\u0131n sonucu\" (as a result of a sudden raid) by \u015eahin Pa\u015fa and Hac\u0131 \u0130lbey. In other words, he\u2019s flagging that the Ottoman source narrative of a surprise attack victory is doubtful, not that the battle itself didn\u2019t happen.\n:That sort of historiographical caution is standard practice and belongs in the article because it shows how modern scholarship treats the early Ottoman chronicles. It doesn\u2019t contradict the rest of the section, it just gives readers a more accurate picture of what \u00d6zcan, a Turkish historian and Ottomanist, actually says in TDV \u0130A. If you think a slightly clearer phrasing would help, I\u2019m fine with adjusting the wording, but the substance, that \u00d6zcan calls the Ottoman version doubtful, should stay per [[WP:V]] and [[WP:DUE]]. -[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 18:59, 13 October 2025 (UTC)\n::Ah, that makes sense then.

Furthermore, Fine first published the book in 1987 - how does that prove that \u2018Skadar\u2019 was the historical English name for Shkod\u00ebr in the 14th century? \n:English speaking authors have only come into contact with Shkod\u00ebr and other Albanian territories from the 19th century onwards (British naval officers, travellers etc from what I\u2019ve read), and they\u2019ve used multiple forms; Scutari, Skadar, and Shkodra, all adapted from non-English languages. I do not believe that the \u201chistorical name\u201d argument realistically applies here, considering that there is no proof that \u2018Skadar\u2019 is the historical English name; you cannot compare it to [[Cologne]], for example.

Per the guideline you outlined in your edit ([[WP:UEGN]]): \"If the place does not exist any more, or the article deals only with a place in a period when it held a different name, the widely accepted historical English name should be used\".

Whether it's more or less than 'Skadar' I suppose cannot be said with certainty, but it would most definitely seem as though Shkod\u00ebr would be the right choice here. [[User:Botushali|Botushali]] ([[User talk:Botushali|talk]]) 17:14, 20 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::Thanks for pulling those sources together and for checking in with {{u|Rosguill}}. I\u2019ve read that exchange carefully and their comment {{tq|we are directed to use the term that English RS use today when discussing the given historical context in particular.}} aligns with the approach here and how we look at how current English language scholarship treats the 1371 context, not how 14th century or early modern English writers referred to it.\n:::::Most of the works you cited, except Madgearu which is a good source here, focus on later Ottoman or broader medieval periods. They\u2019re valuable for understanding the wider historical context but don\u2019t address the 1371 campaign directly which predates Ottoman control of the city. Somel does mention the battle but on page 267 describes it as {{tq|a crusader alliance of Serbs, Hungarians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, and Wallachians}} which contradicts all major scholarly work used in the article that identify it as a Serbian coalition led by Vuka\u0161in and Uglje\u0161a. For this event Fine remains a key English language academic source that directly narrates the battle and consistently uses Skadar. Fine\u2019s explanation in the introduction:\n:::::{{tq|Since control of particular territories in the Balkans has changed over time from Romans or Greeks to different Slavic people to Turks, it is not surprising that there are many different names for some cities. On the whole, I have chosen the name used in the Middle Ages by the power that controlled that place most. Upon first mention (and also in the index) I give the variant names for each place (e.g., Philippopolis [modern Plovdiv], or Durazzo [Dyrrachium, Durres], etc.).}}\n:::::Among the sources used for this article, we also have [https://research.sabanciuniv.edu/id/eprint/8505/1/3021800000030.pdf Aleksandar Shopov\u2019s MA thesis], The Historical Visions of the Battle of the Maritsa / Meri\u00e7 (Sabanc\u0131 University, Istanbul, 2006; supervisor: Yusuf Hakan Erdem). It\u2019s a 149-page academic study written entirely on this battle, making it the only work devoted exclusively to the topic (even though as an unpublished thesis it doesn\u2019t carry the same weight as a peer reviewed publication). Shopov is now a Harvard-trained PhD and Assistant Professor of Early Modern Ottoman History at SUNY Binghamton. On pp. 31\u201332 he writes:\n:::::{{tq|One of the documents from the archives in Dubrovnik (Ragusa) shows that in the early summer of 1371 Vuka\u0161in with his son Marko was in the vicinity of Skadar/Shkod\u00ebr preparing to attack the \u017eupan Nikola Altomanovi\u0107\u2026}}\n:::::Finally I\u2019d also like to offer one strong example that supports your argument. [https://archive.org/details/the-cambridge-history-of-the-byzantine-empire-c.-500-1492-2009 The Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire, c. 500\u20131492 (ed. Jonathan Shepard, Cambridge UP 2009)] which uses Shkod\u00ebr in its 14th century passages:\n:::::{{tq|p. 782: Stefan Du\u0161an (1331\u201355) required Latin priests from Shkod\u00ebr to pay their taxes to the Orthodox bishop of Prizren, a suffragan of Ohrid.}}\n:::::{{tq|p. 788: Relations with Serbia had been damaged by a Slav attack on Shkod\u00ebr after the collapse of the Venetian duchy of Durazzo, and these were now repaired.}}\n:::::Cambridge\u2019s index lists Skadar, Scodra, and Scutari as variants (p. 934). Taken together these examples show that modern English scholarship employs both Skadar and Shkod\u00ebr for this period, depending on author and context. \n:::::As a resolution I propose using \"Skadar (modern Shkod\u00ebr)\" in the article text where the sentence comes from Fine and \"Shkod\u00ebr\" in general prose or where it comes from Madgearu. This reflects Fine\u2019s historically grounded terminology, acknowledges Cambridge, Madgearu and Shopov on variant forms, and follows [[WP:UEGN]] and [[WP:PLACE]]. What do you think? -[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 09:41, 21 October 2025 (UTC)\n::::::I\u2019m glad you\u2019re willing to cooperate here, but I honestly don\u2019t see the point in using two different versions of the same name in a single article based on which author is being cited. If we did that everywhere, Wikipedia articles would be a mess.\n::::::I see the point in such an agreement for cities in which the name has substantially changed and the historical English name is quite established (e.g. [[Tenochtitlan]]/[[Mexico City]], [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]]), but that\u2019s not the case with Shkod\u00ebr from the 15th century until now. \n::::::Furthermore, it would seem there is still some debate on what the historical English term is. Specialist sources on the Battle of Maritsa (a Serbian-Ottoman battle) use \u2018Skadar\u2019, whereas sources discussing or touching on Shkod\u00ebr in the Middle Ages use \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019. Of course, the examples I provided above favour Shkod\u00ebr, but it would most likely be impossible to quantify exactly how many English sources use either term (or \u2018Scutari\u2019 for that matter) when discussing the city in the Middle Ages.\n::::::As such, I would argue that the safest and most logical thing to do would be to simply use the term that we already have on Wikipedia, which is [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. This is also the suggested route according to [[WP:UEGN]], when no historical English name can be identified with certainty. Of course, it\u2019s not all that important whether a town mentioned in passing on one article uses \u2018x\u2019 or \u2018y\u2019, but I feel as though this would set a precedent for other articles relating to Shkod\u00ebr in the Middle Ages, and so that is why I have been this insistent thus far. [[User:Botushali|Botushali]] ([[User talk:Botushali|talk]]) 13:10, 21 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::::Thanks @[[User:Botushali|Botushali]], I agree there\u2019s no need to turn this into a numbers exercise, which is why I didn\u2019t list every individual mention on Google Books. The point isn\u2019t how many sources use one form or another but how modern English-language scholarship treats the 1371 context.\n:::::::As demonstrated earlier, Fine uses Skadar over forty times throughout ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', including every reference to the 1371 campaign. That consistency in a major university press work makes it difficult to dismiss as a one off choice. Shopov (2006) uses Skadar/Shkod\u00ebr for the same event, while ''Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire'' (2009) and ''Madgearu'' (2008) use Shkod\u00ebr. So both forms clearly exist across respected modern sources.\n:::::::Using \"Skadar (modern Shkod\u00ebr)\" in the sentence that comes from Fine isn\u2019t an attempt to fragment the article but to reflect his wording accurately, per [[WP:V]], while keeping the rest of the text consistent with the modern form. That\u2019s a reasonable balance under [[WP:UEGN]] and [[WP:PLACE]] IMO.\n:::::::If there\u2019s still no clear consensus, I\u2019m ok to request a brief neutral comment at [[WP:3O]] so the issue can be settled fairly and we can move on. -[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 14:25, 21 October 2025 (UTC)\n::::::::I think a neutral comment request at WP:3O would be best at this point. Fine is a single author, and I have demonstrated above that other English-speaking authors have used \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 when discussing the town during the 14th century as well; whether they explicitly mention the 1371 campaign is not all that relevant if they use \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 when discussing an event that occurred only a few years prior to or after 1371. So therefore, if there is no consensus on the historical English name (which IMO seems to be Shkod\u00ebr), then as per [[WP:UEGN]], we are supposed to use the historical local name, which is \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019.\n::::::::Even if your reasoning, which is based on only a single source using \u2018Skadar\u2019 in the context of the Battle of Maritsa (even though you\u2019ve acknowledged that Shkod\u00ebr has also been used for the same event), prevails according to a neutral opinion, that should not be extended to other articles, as I have clearly demonstrated the use of \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 as the historical English name when discussing the town in the Middle Ages.\n::::::::Since we clearly won\u2019t reach a consensus, a neutral third opinion would help us conclude this discussion.

The sentence in the article is about an army stationed in Zeta whose capital at the time was Skadar. Britannica and Fine both confirm this. Fine even introduces it as \"Skadar (Scutari, Shkoder, Scodra)\" (p. 51). Writing \"Skadar (modern Shkod\u00ebr)\" reflects that history and keeps the context clear for readers. Using only the modern Albanian form (or the older Illyrian, Latin or Ottoman names) would be inaccurate and confusing, since it implies the capital of Zeta already had that name, which it did not and which the cited source does not say. No newer high level RS shows otherwise. \u2013[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 16:19, 23 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::::::::Multiple sources have been given above that show \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 being used when referring to the town a few years prior, after, and including this time (not explicitly written just about 1371, but the period in general with the year included in that period). The same can probably be found for \u2018Scutari\u2019.\n:::::::::::With all due respect, Aeengath, you can\u2019t keep moving the goal posts just because you don\u2019t want the Albanian version, or another version for that matter. First you claimed that \u2018Skadar\u2019 was the most prevalent historical English name for the Middle Ages, so I brought sources to show that that\u2019s not really the case, and now you\u2019re arguing that sources don\u2019t refer to the campaign directly despite capturing the timeframe that the battle occurred in. Keep in mind, the sources I brought discuss the same time period, when Shkod\u00ebr was under the Balsha.\n:::::::::::You even acknowledged that authors also use \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 in the context of the Battle of Maritsa. Again, I have indicated above that \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 would seem to be more prevalent (at the minimum, it\u2019s just as prevalent) than \u2018Skadar\u2019, and \u2018Scutari\u2019 may perhaps be even more common than that, so really, \u2018Skadar\u2019 is out of the picture.\n:::::::::::{{tquote|Using only the modern Albanian form (or the older Illyrian, Latin or Ottoman names) would be inaccurate and confusing, since it implies the capital of Zeta already had that name\u2026}} The modern Albanian form was also in use in the Middle Ages by Albanians, who dominated the surrounding regions and perhaps Shkod\u00ebr itself demographically. Why wouldn\u2019t it have that name? The Balsha are thought of by many scholars as Albanians, and medieval sources refer to them as Albanian rulers, although of course some scholars think they may have a Slavic or Vlach origin.  Using that, or any other names that fit WP:UEGN (\u2018Skadar\u2019 does not) would not be confusing for readers; in fact, \u2018Skadar\u2019 would be more confusing. Nobody uses that nowadays, nor is it the common English term for the city during the Middle Ages, or 14th century as a whole (not just 1371, all of it under the Balsha, don\u2019t move the goal posts).

'''Skadar''' seems slightly more common than its Albanian rival in general historical (meaning ''about''\u2014mostly Byzantine, medieval, & Renaissance\u2014history) books or papers; and '''Shkod\u00ebr''' seems slightly more common than its Slavic nemesis in the more recent-ish books or papers about (very roughly) the specific time-period in question.  (So... uh... well, that may not have been very enlightening, heh.)\n:* Very often, I see something like ''\"[...] Scutari (Shkod\u00ebr) [...]\".''

I made a note that 'Scutari' should be considered in one of my initial comments above, as I have come across that form many times in the past, although I did not think to compare it to the other two alternatives. Although I don't think Google Ngrams can filter for sources that mention the 14th century in particular, I doubt there'd be much discrepancy? 'Scutari' would most likely prevail in that case, too. Even the 2023 'Historical Dictionary of Montenegro' uses 'Scutari' [https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Historical_Dictionary_of_Montenegro/BS2AEQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Scutari&pg=PA339&printsec=frontcover] when discussing the city before, during and after this time period. However, the 2022 'A Concise History of Albania' (one of the best modern books overviewing Albanian history) uses 'Shkod\u00ebr' for these same time periods. So honestly, I can't really tell, but what I do know is that Fine's book - which is the premise for using 'Skadar' - is almost four decades old, and 'Skadar' does not seem to trump 'Shkod\u00ebr' or 'Scutari' in English sources today when referring to the time period in question.\n::I want it known that I would accept whichever aligns best with the guideline, be it 'Shkod\u00ebr/Shkodra' (both are different tenses of the same name, Albanian grammatical thing), 'Scutari/Skutari' (the former is significantly more prevalent AFAIK) or 'Skadar', but I'm just not convinced that 'Skadar' beats either of the two as the historical English name for the 14th century. As you noted, 'Shkod\u00ebr/Shkodra' would seem to have become increasingly common in modern literature when discussing the time period in question, and of course, that should be taken into account if the other forms have fallen out of use, which is an important concept noted by Rosguill on their TP. I wouldn't mind 'Scutari (modern-day Shkod\u00ebr)' provided its the most common English historical name, but if we cannot say that with certainty, then the Wiki guideline we've all been looking at - [[WP:UEGN]] - clearly suggests that we use it's current name.\n:@[[User:Himaldrmann|Himaldrmann]], do you have a final concluding thought on this as a neutral third party? If you're convinced 'Scutari' is the more prevalent historical English name for this time period, then so be it; if you think that 'Shkod\u00ebr/Shkodra' (the former being the more grammatically correct form in terms of tense) has now become the most common historical English name, then that's fine as well. If you're still very uncertain, then [[WP:UEGN]] states {{tquote|... or the article deals only with a place in a period when it held a different name, the widely accepted historical English name should be used. If there is no such name in English, use the historical name that is now used locally...}} If no widely accepted historical English name can be established, then the guideline would favour the use of 'Shkod\u00ebr', no?\n::I have no qualms if what we conclude follows WP:UEGN appropriately, and it would be good to know so that we can set a precedent moving forward. In the past few months, I've begun working extensively on articles regarding Albania in the Middle Ages, so I'll most definitely need it as a reference for the future :) [[User:Botushali|Botushali]] ([[User talk:Botushali|talk]]) 11:21, 23 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n:::{{ping|Botushali|Aeengath|Himaldrmann}} I removed a longer comment that I posted soon after I posted it. I realized after re-reading it that it needed reworking and clarification, and maybe just should be shorter and more to the point. If I think it would be useful to add more than this comment, I will revise my previous post with the intention of adding to this comment later today or tomorrow. A main point of my comment is that in a modern source, Jacques, Tony. ''Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: A Guide to 8,500 Battles for Antiquity through the Twenty-first Century, Vol. 3'', P-Z Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2007. ISBN 978-0-313-33539-6, page 921, the author captions two later battles as Scutari and in the brief texts describes the battles as assaults \"against Scutari (modern Shkoder).\" The subject battle is listed in Volume 2 under the title Battle of Maritza (without a further explanation of its location.) I think Aeengath's and Hilmaldrmann's interpretations of the guidelines are generally correct and perhaps all the alternatives could be stated in some clear fashion (including perhaps, \"sometimes spelled as...\"). The question then becomes choosing the best way to comply with the guidelines and to provide as much useful and interesting information and identification of places and names (past and present) as possible to the readers without undue omissions or errors.

The only reason why I feel that this is so important is because it will set the precedent for all other related articles that discuss Shkod\u00ebr in the Middle Ages, so whatever is decided here will form the basis for how we go about naming things in those articles as well. I suppose my response should be dictated towards your remaining uncertainties:\n::::* {{tquote|Does the existence of a W.A.H.N. in English in other contexts trump the \"use local name\" clause triggered by the apparent lack of a W.A.H.N. for this particular context?...}} I think the existence of a W.A.H.N. for the 14th century would be heavily-tied to whatever the W.A.H.N. is for the \"neighbouring\" centuries as well. Considering many articles talk about the late 14th/early 15th century in tandem, for example, we can't switch from different forms for two sentences that happened with the same figures/polities but only a few years apart. IMO, it should remain consistent.\n::::* {{tquote|Does \"well, it was known as Skadar to the 14th-century Principality of Zeta\" have any standing, according to the guidelines...}} This is the core of Aeengath\u2019s argument, but as you also noticed, the guidelines don\u2019t say \u201cuse whatever the local ruling power called it at the time\u201d - they say \u201cuse the widely accepted historical English name.\u201d Fine deliberately chose 'Skadar' based on his methodology, but that doesn\u2019t automatically make it the English historical name. The fact that Cambridge, Madgearu, Norris, Kiel, and others use 'Shkod\u00ebr' for the same century shows that \u201cSkadar\u201d is not widely accepted in English, but rather one author\u2019s convention. The guidelines clearly don't support the use of 'Skadar', to this line of argumentation really shouldn't overtake policy in terms of importance.\n::::Furthermore, the Principality of Zeta wasn\u2019t a homogeneous South Slavic state. The ruling [[Balsha family]] is regarded by many scholars as having Albanian origins (see article). Much of the surrounding country was and remains Albanian-speaking: all of the regions neighbouring Shkod\u00ebr such as [[Zadrima]], [[Pult]], [[Mal\u00ebsia e Madhe]], and [[Ana e Malit]] are historically attested as having a dominant Albanian-majority; even in the [[Brda]] region farther north exist several tribes commonly treated in scholarship as of Albanian origin - [[Ku\u010di]], [[Vasojevi\u0107i]], [[Bratono\u017ei\u0107i]], [[Piperi]], [[Bjelopavli\u0107i]], all of which were still Albanian-speaking during the later Middle Ages. Other coastal/montane communities under Balsha influence, e.g. [[Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i]] and [[Malon\u0161i\u0107i]], had strong ethnic Albanian components as well, if not being entirely of Albanian origin. So while sources in the Maritsa context might use 'Skadar', it doesn\u2019t follow that the Principality of Zeta itself - which controlled all of these lands at some point in time in the 14th century - \u201cuniformly\u201d called it that, nor that 'Skadar' is the historically accepted English form for this era. \n::::As a follow-up to your note - {{tquote|... if @Botushali were to source his contention that Shkod\u00ebr was just as, or perhaps even more-so, used at the time, then that might be fairly decisive in favor of Shkod\u00ebr (by this standard)}} - I think I have indicated above that Shkod\u00ebr and its surrounding region consisted primarily of Albanians during this period of time; all of those articles can be checked for their sourced info, I suppose. Furthermore, from 'A Concise History of Albania' (2022) by Schmitt and Fischer, we have the following: {{tquote|Albanians encountered place-names on the Adriatic coast between 150 BC in the north (Ulcinj/Alb. Ulqin, It. Dulcigno, Shkod\u00ebr/Srb. Skadar/It. Scutari, Lezh\u00eb/lt. Alessio)...}} So Albanians, who formed the majority of Shkod\u00ebr and its surrounding regions in this period of time, were using 'Shkod\u00ebr' since at least 150 BC, which I think satisfies your query as to whether or not Shkod\u00ebr was the most commonly-used term at the time - if that's what you meant of course. Either way, I don't think that has any bearing on the guidelines, which should adjudicate the final result of this matter.\n::::In summary, [[User:Donner60|Donner60]] favours 'Scutari (modern day Shkod\u00ebr)', Aeengath favours 'Skadar (modern day Shkod\u00ebr)', and I favour 'Shkod\u00ebr', but I would not mind swapping to 'Scutari (modern day Shkod\u00ebr)' if you, [[User:Himaldrmann|Himaldrmann]], were to support that over 'Shkod\u00ebr', although we simply cannot justify using 'Skadar' according to the given guidelines. So I suppose, with the scores even, it's ultimately up to you. This way, we can finally reach a consensus and put this conversation to rest.\n::::Whatever the case, I think a reasonable fallback would be to include a short explanatory footnote, as Donner suggested, listing all the principal historical forms of the name (Skadar, Scutari, Shkodra, etc.) alongside the modern Shkod\u00ebr - or, if we swing to Scutari, then Scutari (modern day Shkod\u00ebr). That way, readers are fully informed of the variants, we stay consistent with [[WP:UEGN]]/[[WP:PLACE]], and we avoid setting a confusing precedent of name-switching between different articles.

''Britannica (2002)'' describes {{tq|Zeta (...) with its capital at Skadar}} and ''Roberts'' (''2007, Realm of the Black Mountain, p. 8'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QKslEQAAQBAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&printsec=frontcover&dq=Realm+of+the+Black+Mountain&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=then%20known%20as%20Skadar%20(later%20Scutari%2C%20then%20Shkodra)&f=false]) confirm the city was {{tq|then known as Skadar (later Scutari, then Shkodra)}}, clearly showing the chronological progression.\n::::In short, none of these ''Shkod\u00ebr'' sources describe the specific military movement in question: the Zetan army assembling in ''Skadar'' before the Battle of Maritsa.\n::::\u00b9Per [[WP:THESIS]] ''Shopov (2006)'', a 149-page MA thesis supervised by Ottoman historian Yusuf Hakan Erdem, remains the only full-length English study of the Battle of Maritsa. Its findings on Skadar/Shkod\u00ebr align fully with ''Fine (1994)''.\n::::* ''On accuracy and policy'': since the cited source (''Fine 1994, p. 379'') literally use ''Skadar'', substituting another name would detach the text from its citation and contradict [[WP:V]] and [[WP:TSI]]. ''Scutari'' is not the name used in the cited source and only appears a few decades later during the Venetian period, hence its use in ''Tony Jaques (2007)''.

When ''Fine'' writes that {{tq|Vuka\u0161in and his son Marko in the summer of 1371 marched west to Zeta (...) they were all together in Skadar preparing for action}} that phrasing matches both the history and the way the period is described in English scholarship.\n::::For that reason, I believe the policy verifiable and historically precise form is '''Skadar (modern Shkod\u00ebr)''', keeping the sentence aligned with its source and avoiding anachronism. If consensus lands on '''Scutari (modern Shkod\u00ebr)''' for broader consistency as proposed by [[User:Donner60|Donner60]], that\u2019s fine too, as long as we add a short footnote clarifying that ''Scutari'' only became current later under Venetian rule.\n::::-[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 20:57, 26 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::No problem, amigo!

[[User:Donner60|Donner60]] ([[User talk:Donner60|talk]]) 01:47, 27 October 2025 (UTC)\n::::::::OK, so we all agree on a footnote listing the historical variants - that seems like the most constructive compromise and ensures readers get the full picture.\n::::::::That said, I do want to address [[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]]\u2019s repeated reframing that sources discussing the Battle of Maritsa use 'Skadar'. The Battle of Maritsa was a conflict between the Serbs and the Ottomans in what is today Greece, and Shkod\u00ebr is mentioned only in passing. A source passingly mentioning 'Skadar' in reference to Maritsa hardly makes it the \u201chistorical English name\u201d for Shkod\u00ebr in the 14th century. By that logic, if one event uses a certain spelling and another event a few years later uses a different spelling, we would constantly switch names mid-article depending on the author. Imagine how inconsistent and unreadable articles would look if we actually followed that standard. That\u2019s exactly why [[WP:UEGN]] exists - to avoid that kind of arbitrary inconsistency. One term should be used for ''all'' articles.\n::::::::Also, I think we should be cautious about leaning so heavily on Encyclopedia Britannica. Per [[WP:BRITANNICA]], Britannica is a [[WP:TERTIARY]] source. It\u2019s fine to consult, but it doesn\u2019t override broader policy or the weight of usage in modern scholarship. And while Aeengath cites Britannica to support 'Skadar', the article they cited doesn\u2019t explicitly connect their usage of 'Skadar' to Maritsa either - it\u2019s just being highlighted because it aligns with Aeengath's preferred spelling, despite going against the same line of argumentation they keep using.\n::::::::So with the footnote agreed on, we now need to finally decide the main form to use. [[User:Himaldrmann|Himaldrmann]] has indicated support for 'Shkod\u00ebr' (which makes two of us). Aeengath worries that 'Scutari' is anachronistic, but would accept it in order to avoid the Albanian spelling. 'Skadar' is simply not acceptable under the guidelines, as we've established. My preference remains 'Shkod\u00ebr', especially since, as Aeengath pointed out, 'Scutari' is more Venetian and came into use after the Balshas handed the town over to the Republic of Venice in 1396. But, I'm sure sources exist that use 'Scutari' in a 14th-century context. Due to the complexity of the matter, the easiest and least-confusing way to go about this IMO would be to just use '[[Shkod\u00ebr]]', which is the Wiki article's current title, and be done with it. [[WP:UEGN]] clearly states that if no W.A.H.N. exists, we should use the modern local name. If there's no more objections, I'd be happy to insert the footnote on the end of 'Shkod\u00ebr'.

The key is to keep the name consistent with the context described in the article per ''Fine (1994)'' and supported by multiple English-language sources.\n:::::::::-[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 13:45, 27 October 2025 (UTC)\n::::::::::From my understanding, that\u2019s not what the footnote was meant to include. You can\u2019t keep moving the goalposts. I\u2019m happy to agree to a consensus, but not if \u2018Skadar\u2019 keeps getting snuck in as though it has some sort of prominence over the term \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019. \n::::::::::You use the word \u201cchronological\u201d very loosely - \u2018Shkod\u00ebr/Shkodra\u2019 predates the other two terms by many centuries, as confirmed by the quote I used much earlier by Schmitt and Fischer. In fact, the Albanian form \u2018Shkodra\u2019 even predates the arrival of Slavs in the Balkans. So, if we\u2019re going to be ''chronological'' in the footnote here (which is IMO stupid and not called for by guidelines in any way), \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 predates all forms, save for Skodra/Scodra in antiquity. \n::::::::::What I mean by \u201cin passing\u201d, is that when Shkodra is mentioned in the sources that discuss the Battle of Maritsa, it is mentioned passingly with no real prominence in the actual turn of events. The battle was nowhere near Shkod\u00ebr, and its only relevance was that Vuka\u0161in marched from there when summoned by his brother. Not with an army of Shkodrans, either. \n::::::::::As I said, if every article differed in the name it used for events that happened only a few years apart with the same exact polities and characters, Wikipedia articles would be confusing. If x source mentions an event and uses y name, that doesn\u2019t make it the historical English name. If we wrote articles exclusively according to the name which each cited source uses for its corresponding line, you might end up with three or four renditions of the same name in the same article. That\u2019s why we have [[WP:UEGN]], so I\u2019m not sure why you keep arguing for something that is not policy-based in the slightest. Quoting [[WP:V]] and then drawing abstractions from it is quite pointless when we have a policy for this exact issue. If we use \u2018Skadar\u2019 here (which we shouldn\u2019t), it would need to be used on all relevant articles that fall within a similar timeframe, even though \u2018Shkodra\u2019 and \u2018Scutari\u2019 are used as well. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so firm on not letting it go\u2026 [[User:Botushali|Botushali]] ([[User talk:Botushali|talk]]) 14:39, 27 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::::::::I agree with Aeengath that the additional sources that she has discovered justifies the use of Skadar in this article. And she is willing to compromise on how it would be used.\n:::::::::::Based in Botushali's last comment, however, it appears that this cannot be settled by consensus of the three others commenting plus Botushali, since that editor \"won't let go\" of his view that no mention of alternatives should be made. Other comments, perhaps by military history project coordinators or experienced users may need to be sought. Perhaps more likely, it may need to be taken to higher level of dispute resolution. \n:::::::::::I am not persuaded that the mere mention of Skadar under these circumstances is wrong nor do I foresee some sort of confusion or bad consequences in other articles if the use and time frames of the alternative names for the location are are properly explained. I don't agree that an interpretation of the guidelines to exclude even mention of any alternative or historically different names over time is required when the main or title names and locations for the battle are chosen. I think it would be helpful, rather than confusing, to add a footnote (or even in the text) with all the names over time in this case and in others that may be similar - again, as long as the article title and appropriate names for the battle and location at the time are in line with the guidelines. If the consensus of others or a persuasive interpretation can be shown to be different, I would stand corrected, of course. \n:::::::::::The mention of different names for locations of battles and changes of name over time for those locations is not unprecedented in Wikipedia and does not add to confusion or undue length. Different names for the same event, much less different for events years apart, appear to be rather common. \n:::::::::::From the lead: \"The '''Battle of Kemp's Landing''', also known as the '''Skirmish of Kempsville''', was a [[skirmish]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]] that occurred on November 15, 1775.\" From the end of the article: \"Kemp's Landing incorporated in 1778 as [[Kempsville, Virginia|Kempsville]], and became the county seat for [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]].

I think there may be some confusion about my last comment, so let me restate clearly:\n::::::::::::I have never said that \u2018Skadar\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be mentioned at all. My point was that if we went down the \u201cchronological order\u201d path for the footnote (which I don\u2019t support, since the guidelines don\u2019t call for it), then the order would not be what Aeengath suggested \u2014 because \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 predates both \u2018Skadar\u2019 and \u2018Scutari\u2019, as shown by Schmitt & Fischer (2022). What I have consistently said is that I\u2019m fine with \u2018Scutari (modern Shkod\u00ebr)\u2019 if consensus swings that way as a compromise, as long as the footnote is attached listing all common historical variants without giving prominence to one over the other, because that\u2019s not what sources do. We probably don\u2019t even need \u2018(modern Shkod\u00ebr)\u2019 if we hyperlink Scutari and add the footnote immediately after listing all variants.\n::::::::::::As for sources, I\u2019ve already listed several that use Shkod\u00ebr for the exact same time frame, and I\u2019m sure I could find more \u2014 Kiel (1990), Norris (1993), Swire (1937), Madgearu (2008), Cambridge History (2009). Aeengath\u2019s response that \u201cthose don\u2019t describe Maritsa\u201d misses the point, and ironically, neither do all of the sources they just listed. Britannica and Roberts are broad histories that don\u2019t even talk about Maritsa when mentioning Shkod\u00ebr, Truhart is a reference catalogue, and Shopov is an MA thesis (widely-cited though) that uses Skadar/Shkod\u00ebr interchangeably. The fact remains: there is no single \u201cwidely accepted historical English name\u201d across the scholarship. Some say Skadar, some Shkod\u00ebr, some Scutari.\n::::::::::::That is exactly why WP:UEGN exists - to avoid chopping up articles line by line based on whatever spelling each individual author prefers. If we followed Aeengath\u2019s logic, an article might use three different spellings for the same city within the same few decades depending on the source cited, which would be chaotic. It is also strange to have different articles use different spelling for the same timeframe, which is another reason why WP:UEGN exists. Policy resolves this by saying: if there is no widely accepted historical English name, use the local one. That means Shkod\u00ebr, but I\u2019ve already agreed to compromise on \u2018Scutari\u2019 with a footnote, just because it might be more prevalent for the Middle Ages.\n::::::::::::For clarity and consistency across articles, the best policy-compliant solution is IMO: main text = Shkod\u00ebr, with a footnote listing the other forms (Skadar, Scutari, Shkodra, whatever else). That way we stay aligned with guidelines, we respect all the sources, and we give readers the full picture without turning the article into a patchwork of competing spellings. But, failing that, I would agree to \u2018Scutari\u2019 with a footnote doing the same. \n::::::::::::Finally, [[User:Donner60|Donner60]], I don\u2019t think the American Revolutionary War and Civil War examples you cite are actually comparable here. Those cases involve places whose names changed later under the same line of polities (e.g. towns incorporated, merged, or renamed) and editors noting both the old and new forms. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re dealing with in Shkod\u00ebr. Shkod\u00ebr was not some later invention or renaming; it was already the native/local form in use during the 14th century, alongside the other variants. The situation is different because we\u2019re not choosing between a former name that disappeared and a modern name that replaced it - we\u2019re choosing between several co-existing exonyms, none of which is the \u201cwidely accepted historical English name\u201d. That is exactly the scenario WP:UEGN was written for, and it points us clearly toward the local name. \n::::::::::::I think an RfC would be a bit too much, the reason why it\u2019s dragged out is because, realistically, the form used here should be used on corresponding articles. So, in a way, it\u2019s deciding those articles too. If we really want to make a special exception where only one article on Wiki uses \u2018Skadar\u2019 for the Middle Ages, sure I guess, but I would hope such usage wouldn\u2019t spread to similar articles, because this whole debate will have to be repeated again and again... [[User:Botushali|Botushali]] ([[User talk:Botushali|talk]]) 03:50, 28 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::::::::::This begins to seem like everyone is favoring the same general solution for naming all the locations in this article by mentioning them all in one way or another. Perhaps we are talking past each other to some extent. It also seems that I misunderstood your comment that you were against the footnote proposal insofar as it would continue to include Skadar. I am not opposed to your proposal and definitely favor Scutari for the main text with other mentions being in a footnote. The naming in relevant sources should govern. \n:::::::::::::My thought o precent is that this situation, because of few and conflicting sources, and different times of other articles, isn't necessarily a precedent for other articles. You do seem to be limiting this to the Middle Ages in this area. I presume that would not be a large number of articles, which considerably excludes or narrows the possible disagreements with respect to the far larger number of military history articles overall. In this case, I think that there are enough sources to support mention of all the possible names here. I presume that might not always be true or if properly presented, verified by sources and explained, would not pose much problem.\n:::::::::::::So we may not be pointing to a higher or more complicated dispute resolution procedure, which would be a good thing on which I think we can all agree. \n:::::::::::::I would also be remiss not to thank you for your extensive work in improving these articles.

Narrowing to the single prelude sentence this concerns, two sources use Skadar: Fine (1994, p. 379) ({{tq|in Skadar preparing for action}}) and Shopov (2006, pp. 22\u201323) {{tq|withdraw from Skadar}}; Shopov is a topic-specific source cited by Reinert 2021, Schmitt 2016, and Boykov 2024 as mentioned [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABattle_of_Maritsa&diff=1319072964&oldid=1319052231 earlier]).\n\nI initially supported Scutari to help close the discussion but that was before confirming Shopov\u2019s corroboration and its use by leading medieval Balkan specialists.

Within that narrow frame, the two English RS that narrate it both use ''Skadar'', which we have seen from RS previously (that I wont list again here) was the name of the Zetan capital:\n::Fine (1994, p. 379): {{tq|Vukasin and his son Marko in the summer of 1371 marched west to Zeta to join the Bal\u0161i\u0107i in a planned coalition against Nicholas Altomanovi\u0107.

His thesis has since been used by Stephen W.

The aim is simply that when two independent event narrating RS align for a single sentence, we mirror that form for accuracy. The rest of the article can keep a single consistent term per [[WP:UEGN]], supported by a short note listing the other common variants, so I have no objection to using ''Shkod\u00ebr'', ''Scutari'' or ''Scodra'' elsewhere where that fits the context.\n::That leaves us with a straightforward, policy clean wording that matches the paragraph\u2019s pattern the way it is right now {{tq|Ottoman capital, Adrianople (modern Edirne) (...) near the Maritsa River at Chernomen (modern Ormenio).}}\n::'''''According to historians John Fine and Aleksandar Shopov, Vuka\u0161in\u2019s army was in Skadar (modern Shkod\u00ebr) preparing for action when Uglje\u0161a summoned him.'''(Fine 1994, p. 379; Shopov 2006, pp. 22\u201323.)''\n::That keeps verifiability, reflects the event sources and stays fully consistent with [[WP:PLACE]]/[[WP:UEGN]].\n::(And yes, I caught your minor note, I promise I read it all, formatting and all)\n::\u2013\u2013[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 21:11, 28 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::Using \u2018Skadar\u2019 does not actually agree with [[WP:UEGN]]. Adrianople and Chernomen are the W.A.H.N. for this time period - that\u2019s why they\u2019re being used, not because of [[WP:V]]. A W.A.H.N. doesn\u2019t exist for only a single year in history before swapping over to something else for the time before and the time after.

I have not checked to see if it says anything about Maritsa, but  the entire journal articles uses \u2018Shkodra\u2019, and only mentions \u2018Skadar\u2019 once at the beginning: {{tquote|\u2026 between the residents of Shkodra (Skadar in Slav.) \u2026}} So although it acknowledges \u2018Skadar\u2019, as we have all agreed to do so under a footnote here, the preferred name for this time period (1371 included) is Shkod\u00ebr/Shkodra.\n:::* Premovi\u0107, Temizer & Stankovi\u0107, \u2018Zeta Under the Bal\u0161i\u0107 Dynasty and the Ottoman Empire (1385\u20131421)\u2019 (2024) [https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=1288056] - Although the article focuses on 1385 onwards (only 14 years after Maritsa), it does say the following: {{tquote|The Bal\u0161i\u0107 brothers Stracimir, \u0110ura\u0111 I, and Bal\u0161a II ruled Zeta from 1360 to 1421.

Using Shkodra elsewhere in a wide economic study is just modernisation for readability, not evidence of a W.A.H.N.\n::::Premovi\u0107 et al. (2024) starts in 1385, Molina (2020) focuses on 1392\u20131402 Venice and Zachariadou (1988) covers 1380\u20131418 under Venetian rule so all well after the event in question, when Zeta was no longer independent, the city was under different rule and linguistic influences, and known under a different name.\n::::Broader regional works often use a single modern form across long periods for convenience, but event-specific scholarship uses the form current in the period described, that's what specific historical context is about.\n::::You wrote that {{tq|'''A W.A.H.N. doesn\u2019t exist for only a single year in history before swapping over to something else for the time before and the time after.'''}} In practice, that\u2019s exactly how [[WP:PLACE]] handles historical naming when context changes. \n::::It\u2019s the same principle used elsewhere on Wikipedia: when describing events in Saint Petersburg, historians write Petrograd for the [[February Revolution]] and Leningrad for the [[Siege of Leningrad|1941\u20131944 Siege]], each reflecting the name used at that specific time. Likewise, the 1371 staging described by Fine and Shopov took place when the city was known as Skadar within the Principality of Zeta; the Venetian Scutari and Albanian Shkod\u00ebr forms belong to different periods and can be listed in a note for clarity as suggested by @[[User:Donner60|Donner60]].\n::::Given that none of the sources cited cover Zeta or the 1371 campaign directly, they don\u2019t establish a different W.A.H.N. for this context. \n::::-[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]] ([[User talk:Aeengath|talk]]) 10:04, 29 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::::[[User:Aeengath|Aeengath]], with respect, your argument leans far too heavily on [[WP:CHERRYPICK|cherry-picking]] two sources that describe one very narrow campaign only slightly linked to Shkod\u00ebr, and then inflating those into a claim about the \u201caccepted historical name\u201d for the entire period. That\u2019s not how [[WP:UEGN]] works, as I\u2019ve had to say over and over and over again. A W.A.H.N. isn\u2019t determined by whether a single historian opts for \u2018Skadar\u2019 in one event narrative; rather, it\u2019s determined by broader scholarly usage across the timeframe in question. \n:::::That\u2019s why I cited Premovi\u0107, Molina, Zachariadou, and others before that - not because they narrate Maritsa at great depth itself (although they do mention it), but because they show that in the same chronological window (before, during, and after 1371), the preference across wider scholarship is for Shkod\u00ebr (or Scutari). Premovi\u0107 and Giakoumis even make a point of saying {{tquote|\u2026 between the residents of Shkodra (Skadar in Slav.) \u2026}}, mentioning \u2018Skadar\u2019 only once as the term in ''Slavic'' (not as the historical English name), before reverting exclusively to Shkodra throughout the study. That\u2019s an acknowledgment of a variant, not a declaration that it was the accepted name. To spin it otherwise is misleading, and your selective framing and misquoting of that sentence goes against [[WP:V]], which you insist on using inappropriately.\n:::::The idea that [[WP:V]] or [[WP:PLACE]] require us to replicate whatever spelling one author happens to use for one sentence is simply not what policy dictates. What policy ''does'' dictate is that, when no single W.A.H.N. exists, use the local name. That\u2019s Shkod\u00ebr. The compromise on \u2018Scutari\u2019 with a footnote listing variants already respected that balance and could have closed this discussion some time ago.\n:::::Insisting instead on elevating \u2018Skadar\u2019 based on two selective references isn\u2019t policy-driven, it\u2019s cherry-picking. It doesn\u2019t outweigh the wider literature, and it certainly doesn\u2019t override the naming guideline that applies here, as I\u2019ve had to repeatedly state an untold number of times to the point where it\u2019s just getting ridiculous. Also, the Petrograd/Leningrad analogy doesn\u2019t apply. It\u2019s a false comparison. Those were official state-imposed name changes with hard start and end dates that are reflected in sources on their respective eras. Shkod\u00ebr was never \u201crenamed\u201d to \u2018Skadar\u2019 in that sense, because these are parallel exonyms that coexisted in the literature, and the usage of \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019 predates \u2018Skadar\u2019 by more than roughly five centuries as cited above to Schmitt and Fischer\u2026\n:::::At this point, I honestly don\u2019t know if your comments are AI-generated or something, because you keep missing the core point that\u2019s been re-stated over and over again and recycling the same misread of policy as though repetition makes it true. We were close to resolving this with consensus around \u2018Scutari\u2019 + footnote, but you\u2019re dragging this out by pushing a form that has clearly not been shown to be the W.A.H.N.

Although just because you\u2019re pushing for \u2018Skadar\u2019 with no compromise, we should honestly stick exactly to what [[WP:UEGN]] says and go for \u2018Shkod\u00ebr\u2019, the local name, but I wouldn\u2019t want to waste anyone\u2019s time any further.

So I think the proposed compromise is the best we can do in this case without dragging it on.

I think little more is likely to result from spending more time on it. It is up to each of you as to whether you think that other opinions should be sought or whether this needs to be resolved by a wider group or a higher level. I do think we are in position to accept a consensus among ourselves. Perhaps a future discussion on the precise topic at issue might even come in a future and clearer case than this one - rather than in this one.

The first record only states that Nobunaga employed him as a porter and gave him a few stipends after Alessandro Valignano gave Yasuke to Nobunaga. In addition to this, the second one (diary) simply records physical characteristics of Yasuke. The third one depicts how Mitsuhide Akechi \uff08[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akechi_Mitsuhide|\u660e\u667a\u5149\u79c0]]\uff09decided to treat Yasuke immediately after Nobunaga died. \nFrom these materials, it is clear that there is no fact that Yasuke achieved the status of a samurai.\n\nFirst of all, the crucial point is that when a lord Nobunaga died, if Yasuke was a samurai and one of liegemen close to Nobunaga, he should be killed at the same time or he should commit seppuku. But it's written in the Jesuit Annual Report of Japan that, Akechi said \"This black guy is a beast (an animal, not a human), he doesn't know anything, and he's not Japanese, so I won't kill him\" and let Yasuke go, saying, \"Leave him with an Indian priest\"\n\nSecond important point is that Yasuke was not given a surname, which a \"real\" samurai would have had.\n\nMoreover, if he had achieved some military exploits as a samurai, there would have been some kind of records left (like other Sengoku warlords), but none of such remains.\n\nFor these reasons, it is a commonly held opinion among Japanese that Yasuke was not a samurai.\nIn other words, Yasuke did not do anything worthy of records, and that's why most Japanese people have not cared about his existence much.\nJapanese historican Dr. Yuichi Goza concluded that Yasuke was \"in fact Nobunaga\u2019s porter and a kind of entertainer\". ([[https://www.sankei.com/article/20240805-2RDCMCMKMNFYFOGXMRGPCIT2NI/ \u5f25\u52a9\u554f\u984c\u300c\u672c\u4eba\u306f\u82b8\u4eba\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u7acb\u5834\u300d\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306e\u4e0d\u6e80\u306f\u5f53\u7136\u300d\u3000\u6b74\u53f2\u5b66\u8005\u30fb\u5449\u5ea7\u6c0f\u306b\u805e\u304f]])\n\nWhilst the theory \"Yasuke was a samurai\" quickly spread overseas due to the book written by Thomas Lockley and due to the falsification of English Wikipedia's \"Yasuke\" entry. \n\nThe latter was also actually done by Lockley himself spending more than 10 years- citing his unpublished book (then after publishing the book, he changed that citation to the published book). \nIn the Japanese version of his book, Lockley made a small disclaimer, saying that most parts of his book are mere conjecture without any historical fact-checking, in other words, it's a fiction. \nBut in the English version, he treated those parts of his own fiction as if they were facts,writing them in assertive tone. \n\nRegarding Wikipedia's \"Yasuke\" entry, there's no description that Yasuke was a samurai in Japanese page, but in English page, it's written like \"served as a samurai to the Japanese daimy\u014d Oda Nobunaga for a period of 15 months between 1581 and 1582\", which had been obviously edited by Lockely using the pseudonym Tottoritom, and it's still there (now that English page got locked (non-editable)...probably because of the flood of criticism against his fabrication?).\n\nThis has led to huge misunderstandings about Yasuke among many foreigners. \n\nNot only video games, movies, and musicals have been made based on his fiction, but also new Yasuke stories based on Lockley's books have been made- for example, other novels written by other \"foreign\" authors who don't speak or read Japanese, either not study Japanese history in an accademic/objective manner. \nAnd most of these claim to be\u3000\"historically accurate\" or \"true to the real history\" even though they are just a fiction. Also some TV shows including BBC, saying \"non-fiction\" which is not true. \n\nEven worse is that this falsification has been used by some activists to degrade other groups of people.\nIn Japan, this is viewed as a very problematic issue. Even Japanese Diet members have begun investigating this matter. \nLockley works at Nihon University, but now he has been hiding himslf from the public since the issue was discovered in the spring of this year.

It\u2019s a well sourced statement, and while the brevity oversimplifies the secondary sources (I don\u2019t understand why his article is all-wikivoice without mentioning the discussion) it\u2019s pretty well established that by the standards of the late Sengoku he was absolutely a samurai, and oversimplied brevity is fine in a passing reference in another article.

Option A is better formatted, doesn't include the (also re-added with without proper discussion) \"slave\" comments in the photo descriptions (which seem to be part of the core reason for the edit warring going on here), and The first reference link in Option B leads to a redirect rather than the quoted journal article, so I don't know how the rest of you are claiming it's well cited (other than that dead link, they cite the exact same references). While the historical paintings are nice to include, I find an article on a currently existing group of people should probably open with famous and/or people of that group rather than non-\"Japanese residents or citizens\" such as, if the depicted '''are''' Dutch slaves, people who would be considered neither. Certainly their presence should be mentioned historically in relation to black visitors to Japan, but images of them shouldn't outnumber current Black Japanese. Either way, the article should include the sidebar from Option A.

There isn't any source that supports that anyone in that picture was even born in Japan, or has a Japanese parent, or was naturalized so it isn't a valid picture for this article to begin with.\n\n:The other major addition, also by the same vandal, was the addition of a sentence that compares black people to animals. It isn't [[WP:DUE]], and it was clearly added with the intent of being disparaging.

It seems like the primary debates are 1) whether to include images with references to slavery, and 2) whether to describe black folks in Japan as being of \"African ancestry\" or, using a more nuanced, \"Black racial groups of Africa\". Is that the meat of this debate? [[User:NotJamestack]] mentioned that sourced content was getting removed. Which sourced content exactly? My initial impression is that we might want to <u>break this RfC into a series of questions</u>, cause it seems clear to me that Option A is obviously better with respect to the images, but I don't really know what the right thing to do on the African ancestry thing. There may be some \"US centrism\" issues here, cause in the US, we tend to use the term \"African American\" as general descriptor for black folks, in a way that other countries do not. [[User:NickCT|NickCT]] ([[User talk:NickCT|talk]]) 14:45, 2 December 2025 (UTC)\n*:I believe you have found the heart of the matter. I'd also argue that including an image of people who wouldn't be considered Black Japanese (over contemporary actual Black Japanese) as the first one you see when you open the article is problematic, regardless of how long it was allowed to remain there.\n*:I'm pretty sure the removed content @[[User:NotJamestack|NotJamestack]] was referencing is the opening paragraph in Option B (the reference link to which no longer leads to the quoted journal article and would have to be fixed, as the site hosting it has been moved, should that end up the selected option). As far as I can tell from reading that section in both versions, that paragraph is the only difference in that section beyond paragraphs being shuffled around. Other differences are the African ancestry/Black racial groups of Africa difference in the lede and the image captions and placement.\n*:In my opinion the opening paragraph is a bit much and could be rendered down to to a single sentence, like the one mentioning the [[Perry Expedition]], and nothing would be lost. The article's focus isn't visitors of either \"African ancestry\" nor \"Black racial groups of Africa\" but on Japanese residents or citizens from that group. Could even just open with the paragraph on Yasuke (as he was reportedly given a residence, a weapon, and a stipend by Nobunaga it's hard not to argue that he was, even if briefly, a true resident of Japan) if you wanted to keep the timeline straight in the history section.\n*:The main reason this RFC exists is because there was an ongoing edit war with multiple editors reverting to one of these two versions of the article. I think after one version or the other is selected, the edit warring ends, and hopefully civility is restored among the editors, things like fine-tuning the lede, fixing minor things, expanding the article, etc. can continue without the need for more RFCs.

Those are from following three documents: '''''Shin-Ch\u014d-Kouki'''''([https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BF%A1%E9%95%B7%E5%85%AC%E8%A8%98 \u4fe1\u9577\u516c\u8a18]), written in 1610 which is a chronicle of Nobunaga's life; '''''Ietada diary'''''([https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%BE%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%B6%E5%BF%A0#%E5%AE%B6%E5%BF%A0%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98 \u5bb6\u5fe0\u65e5\u8a18]) written by Ietada Matsudaira\uff08\u677e\u5e73\u5bb6\u5fe0\uff09, a vassal of the Tokugawa clan during 1575-94; and \"'''''[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%83%AD%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B9%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E5%8F%B2 Jesuit Annual Report of Japan]'''''\" written by a jesuit missionary, Lu\u00eds Fr\u00f3is in 1582. The first record only states that Nobunaga employed him as a porter and gave him a few stipends after Alessandro Valignano gave Yasuke to Nobunaga. In addition to this, the second one (diary) simply records physical characteristics of Yasuke. The third one depicts how Mitsuhide Akechi \uff08[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akechi_Mitsuhide|\u660e\u667a\u5149\u79c0]]\uff09decided to treat Yasuke immediately after Nobunaga died. \nFrom these materials, it is clear that there is no fact that Yasuke achieved the status of a samurai.\n\nFirst of all, the crucial point is that when a lord Nobunaga died, if Yasuke was a samurai and one of liegemen close to Nobunaga, he should be killed at the same time or he should commit seppuku. But it's written in the Jesuit Annual Report of Japan that, Akechi said \"This black guy is a beast (an animal, not a human), he doesn't know anything, and he's not Japanese, so I won't kill him\" and let Yasuke go, saying, \"Leave him with an Indian priest\"\n\nSecond important point is that Yasuke was not given a surname, which a \"real\" samurai would have had.\n\nMoreover, if he had achieved some military exploits as a samurai, there would have been some kind of records left (like other Sengoku warlords), but none of such remains.\n\nFor these reasons, it is a commonly held opinion among Japanese that Yasuke was not a samurai.\nIn other words, Yasuke did not do anything worthy of records, and that's why most Japanese people have not cared about his existence much.\nJapanese historican Dr. Yuichi Goza concluded that Yasuke was \"in fact Nobunaga\u2019s porter and a kind of entertainer\". ([[https://www.sankei.com/article/20240805-2RDCMCMKMNFYFOGXMRGPCIT2NI/ \u5f25\u52a9\u554f\u984c\u300c\u672c\u4eba\u306f\u82b8\u4eba\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u7acb\u5834\u300d\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306e\u4e0d\u6e80\u306f\u5f53\u7136\u300d\u3000\u6b74\u53f2\u5b66\u8005\u30fb\u5449\u5ea7\u6c0f\u306b\u805e\u304f]])\n\nWhilst the theory \"Yasuke was a samurai\" quickly spread overseas due to the book written by Thomas Lockley and due to the falsification of English Wikipedia's \"Yasuke\" entry. \n\nThe latter was also actually done by Lockley himself spending more than 10 years- citing his unpublished book (then after publishing the book, he changed that citation to the published book). \nIn the Japanese version of his book, Lockley made a small disclaimer, saying that most parts of his book are mere conjecture without any historical fact-checking, in other words, it's a fiction. \nBut in the English version, he treated those parts of his own fiction as if they were facts,writing them in assertive tone. \n\nRegarding Wikipedia's \"Yasuke\" entry, there's no description that Yasuke was a samurai in Japanese page, but in English page, it's written like \"served as a samurai to the Japanese daimy\u014d Oda Nobunaga for a period of 15 months between 1581 and 1582\", which had been obviously edited by Lockely using the pseudonym Tottoritom, and it's still there (now that English page got locked (non-editable)...probably because of the flood of criticism against his fabrication?).\n\nThis has led to huge misunderstandings about Yasuke among many foreigners. \n\nNot only video games, movies, and musicals have been made based on his fiction, but also new Yasuke stories based on Lockley's books have been made- for example, other novels written by other \"foreign\" authors who don't speak or read Japanese, either not study Japanese history in an accademic/objective manner. \nAnd most of these claim to be\u3000\"historically accurate\" or \"true to the real history\" even though they are just a fiction. Also some TV shows including BBC, saying \"non-fiction\" which is not true. \n\nEven worse is that this falsification has been used by some activists to degrade other groups of people.\nIn Japan, this is viewed as a very problematic issue. Even Japanese Diet members have begun investigating this matter. \nLockley works at Nihon University, but now he has been hiding himslf from the public since the issue was discovered in the spring of this year.

[[User:KeiTakahashi999|KeiTakahashi999]] ([[User talk:KeiTakahashi999|talk]]) 10:15, 9 December 2024 (UTC)\n:::He appears because Yasuke was a Japanese citizen of African ancestry while he was there.

[[User:Bladeandroid|Bladeandroid]] ([[User talk:Bladeandroid|talk]]) 23:13, 14 January 2025 (UTC)\n::::Clearly, Yasuke was not the first man of African decent in Edo (Tokyo) and Japan st large. He must have come to limelight due to his association with some European or Japanese of repute. \n::::Again, it may have been out of segregation against skin colour that have led to distortion or disappearance of early authentic writings about the \"black\" (African) peoples of Japan.\n::::Whatever was truth has possibly been lost in time. However, early Japanese art depictions vividly attests to the undeniable fact that the \"black\" people of Japan walked and lived in Japan, contributing daily to the balance and growth of the Japanese empire. This can never be taken away, Yasuke as Samurai or not.

Option A is better formatted, doesn't include the (also re-added with without proper discussion) \"slave\" comments in the photo descriptions (which seem to be part of the core reason for the edit warring going on here), and The first reference link in Option B leads to a redirect rather than the quoted journal article, so I don't know how the rest of you are claiming it's well cited (other than that dead link, they cite the exact same references). While the historical paintings are nice to include, I find an article on a currently existing group of people should probably open with famous and/or people of that group rather than non-\"Japanese residents or citizens\" such as, if the depicted '''are''' Dutch slaves, people who would be considered neither. Certainly their presence should be mentioned historically in relation to black visitors to Japan, but images of them shouldn't outnumber current Black Japanese. Either way, the article should include the sidebar from Option A.

It seems like the primary debates are 1) whether to include images with references to slavery, and 2) whether to describe black folks in Japan as being of \"African ancestry\" or, using a more nuanced, \"Black racial groups of Africa\". Is that the meat of this debate? [[User:NotJamestack]] mentioned that sourced content was getting removed. Which sourced content exactly? My initial impression is that we might want to <u>break this RfC into a series of questions</u>, cause it seems clear to me that Option A is obviously better with respect to the images, but I don't really know what the right thing to do on the African ancestry thing. There may be some \"US centrism\" issues here, cause in the US, we tend to use the term \"African American\" as general descriptor for black folks, in a way that other countries do not. [[User:NickCT|NickCT]] ([[User talk:NickCT|talk]]) 14:45, 2 December 2025 (UTC)\n*:I believe you have found the heart of the matter. I'd also argue that including an image of people who wouldn't be considered Black Japanese (over contemporary actual Black Japanese) as the first one you see when you open the article is problematic, regardless of how long it was allowed to remain there.\n*:I'm pretty sure the removed content @[[User:NotJamestack|NotJamestack]] was referencing is the opening paragraph in Option B (the reference link to which no longer leads to the quoted journal article and would have to be fixed, as the site hosting it has been moved, should that end up the selected option). As far as I can tell from reading that section in both versions, that paragraph is the only difference in that section beyond paragraphs being shuffled around. Other differences are the African ancestry/Black racial groups of Africa difference in the lede and the image captions and placement.\n*:In my opinion the opening paragraph is a bit much and could be rendered down to to a single sentence, like the one mentioning the [[Perry Expedition]], and nothing would be lost. The article's focus isn't visitors of either \"African ancestry\" nor \"Black racial groups of Africa\" but on Japanese residents or citizens from that group. Could even just open with the paragraph on Yasuke (as he was reportedly given a residence, a weapon, and a stipend by Nobunaga it's hard not to argue that he was, even if briefly, a true resident of Japan) if you wanted to keep the timeline straight in the history section.\n*:The main reason this RFC exists is because there was an ongoing edit war with multiple editors reverting to one of these two versions of the article. I think after one version or the other is selected, the edit warring ends, and hopefully civility is restored among the editors, things like fine-tuning the lede, fixing minor things, expanding the article, etc. can continue without the need for more RFCs.

[[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] <small>[[User talk:Pmanderson|PMAnderson]]</small> 22:38, 25 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n*'''Oppose''' - the redirect header is sufficient. The Italian name for the city is the primary usage in English (especially since the \"Pass\" is always used in that way). People looking for the person will find him without problem the was it is, whilst the city will get lost in a plethora of related usages. --[[User:Stomme|Stomme]] ([[User talk:Stomme|talk]]) 23:29, 25 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n*<s>'''Incredibly, super-strongly support with extra powerful support that beats all other kinds of opposition, in virtue of its strongness'''</s> Disambiguation pages are meant to organize topics, not cut down on the number of clicks.  As for primary usage, this passage from [[WP:D]] is relevant:\n\n::'''Primary topic'''\n::When there is a well known primary meaning for a term or phrase, much more used than any other (this may be indicated by a majority of links in existing articles or by consensus of the editors of those articles that it will be significantly more commonly searched for and read than other meanings), then that topic may be used for the title of the main article, with a disambiguation link at the top. If there's a disambiguation page, it should link back to the primary topic.\n::If there is extended discussion about which article truly is the primary topic, that may be a sign that there is in fact no primary topic, and that the disambiguation page should be located at the plain title with no \"(disambiguation)\".\n\n:As for which usage is primary in English, I'd say that's far from decided.  The article on the city receives about twice the traffic as the article on the person, and has about four times the number of incoming links &mdash; but a search on google or yahoo (ignoring Wikipedia page results) turns up results for the person before the city.  So Wikipedia seems to favor the city, but the web as a whole favors the person as the primary usage for the name.  Since \"Bolzano\" isn't even agreed upon as the proper name in English (see the various past arguments in the [[/Archive 1|talk archive]]) I don't see how it is at all a settled matter.  (BTW, putting \"strongly\" in front of support/opposition is silly.)  --[[User:Sapphic|Sapphic]] ([[User talk:Sapphic|talk]]) 00:08, 26 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n:* '''Oppose''' Given the obvious lack of consensus for a move, and given a few more days to think about the issue and to try to think how the rest of you could be so obviously wrong yet think you're right, I've decided that you are, in fact, right.  The way I think about it now that makes sense to me is that [[Bolzano]] should only be ''at most'' a '''redirect''' to [[Bernard Bolzano]], and would never be the canonical name for the article on the person.  However, [[Bolzano]] is ''currently'' the canonical name for the article on the city.  So, given a conflict, the article on the city gets priority, and a hat note (already added by [[User:PMAnderson]], thank you!).   '''However''' &mdash; and here is where I think I perhaps still differ from the others in the discussion &mdash; if this were a case of redirect vs. redirect or canonical name vs. canonical name, I think we would be obliged to have [[Bolzano]] either ''be'' or ''redirect to'' the disambiguation page.  This is an important point to consider, if the name of the article ever changes (again) and [[Bolzano]] is again turned into a redirect.  Anyway, I thank everyone involved for helping to sort out this issue.  --[[User:Sapphic|Sapphic]] ([[User talk:Sapphic|talk]]) 21:33, 28 April 2008 (UTC)\n::<small>p.s.

I looked only at English pages, and removed Bernard and Bernardo from both searches to eliminate, in balance, any pages about the mathemetician. I also ignored Wikipedia, to keep our own pages from influencing the numbers: For \"bolzano -bozen -bernard -bernardo -wikipedia\" I get 298,000 pages, and for \"bozen -bolzano -bernard -bernardo -wikipedia\" I get 118,000 pages. That's a bit over twice as much for the Italian name, in English. And actually, all the previous search show is that the word \"city\" probably occurs on more German pages than Italian, since the search wasn't limited to English. A Google search as before, but only including English still favours Bolzano (although the person probably influences the numbers somewhat): 'Bolzano city' gives 452,000 and 'Bozen city' gives 98,000. While I am more than happy to call the city Bozen myself, for the English Wikipedia Bolzano is the proper name based on common usage and naming conventions. I also maintain my previous vote to oppose based on the fact that [[Bernard Bolzano]] already has a disambiguation in his name (Bernard) and changing the article to [[Bolzano (city)]] will just mean a lot of unnecessary piping and link maintenance (no links to the person should be referring to him by last name only if the MOS is followed). And I fear that this discussion will soon no longer be about separating the city from the person, but from separating the German and the Italian sides (again). --[[User:Stomme|Stomme]] ([[User talk:Stomme|talk]]) 08:56, 28 April 2008 (UTC)\n::::(You get Matthead's results searching for \"bolzano city\" and \"bozen city\" without quotation marks)--'''[[User:Supparluca|<span style=\"color:green;\">Suppar</span>]][[User talk:Supparluca|<span style=\"color:red;\">luca</span>]]''' 09:18, 28 April 2008 (UTC)\n::: Actually, my search is without quotation marks; I had used single quotes in my previous comment hoping to eliminate the ambiguity.

I'll just come on here to state that the sentence claiming Bolzano was an ethnic German city, because 95% spoke German, is bogus.  Mother tongue does not equal ethnicity, sorry to break it to you.  My mother tongue is English, I am not English. Jean Alessi's mother tongue is French, he is not French.  You all completely pass over the fact that the people of Trentino Alto Adige were essentially all Ladin speakers at one point, until the German language along with some ethnic Germans migrated and mixed into this area.  There are people all over the province of Bolzano with dark hair and features, having surnames like Seppi, or Rainer, (two names I know go back for centuries in Bolzano) who speak the German language because it was under a German-speaking crown.  duh!  Of course these same families likely have mixed roots of German, maybe some people from Veneto, Friuli, whatever.  The point is that the great thing about this region is this mixture, and all you seem intent on doing is making it trivial.  I don't know how many times I have to explain this to the group who think this area was simply some ''purely'' German \"ethnic\" area that was invaded.  I guess that makes it easier to process for some people's minds... @_@  [[User:Icsunonove|Icsunonove]] ([[User talk:Icsunonove|talk]]) 09:46, 19 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n:: You are mistaken: The multi-ethnic Austrian Empire explicitly asked the ethnicity of the people and not the language! 95,5% declared them to be ''German''! The statement is referenced - it is a publication by the city of Bolzano! also: there are just 326 people named Seppi in the entire province [http://qlikview.provincia.bz.it/bnarc/Webform2.aspx] and 1512 Rainer, but than Rainer is a GERMAN name [[Rainer]] - so rightly there are lots of them in the province. --[[User:Noclador|noclador]] ([[User talk:Noclador|talk]]) 09:57, 19 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n::: So you like names - for you they prove the ethnicity of person; ''GOOD'' here is the list with the 120 most common names in the province of Bolzano 2004 - to make it easier for you I highlighted the 2 Italian and the 4 Ladin ones [http://img158.imageshack.us/img158/4430/namesnq1.png in Green and Blue: ] - and saved myself the work to highlight the ''114 German'' ones! --[[User:Noclador|noclador]] ([[User talk:Noclador|talk]]) 10:50, 19 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::* Noclador, I'm seriously concerned you are going to have a stroke. =)  Please, relax, and when you do, we obviously can discuss this better.  I don't say I'm right about everything, you might want to consider that it may be healthy for yourself to look at this with an open mind as well.  By the way, there are quite a few Rainer in Trentino as well; do you want to notify them they are \"ethnic\" Germans? :)  I've told you before, you continue to insist on making things ''black and white'', yet they are not, nor will ever be.  If you don't want to accept that the region is not made up of some singular and pure ethnicity, that is up to you -- it doesn't matter to me really.  I know people who speak Ladino dialects, yet when asked they identify them as dialects of Italian (Tuscan).  Point being?  Asking everyday people does not result in necessarily real results.  Of course many people who spoke German at that time will call themselves \"German\", but what do you think happened to the original Ladin and Latin speakers of this region before Germanic people migrated down here a few centuries ago?  They evaporated?  My point is that the people of Trentino-Alto Adige ARE Germanic, but they are also Italic... and they are Ladino-dolomiten, and they are Roman, and they are Etruscan.  How long as your family been in Trentino-Alto Adige Noclador?  Are you blonde and blue eyes with a jaw like Michael Schumacher?   Somehow, I'm willing to bet the answer is NO.  Lastly, let me pose to you two questions: 1)  Who in fact are the \"Italians\"?  and 2) Why were the vast majority of towns in Alto Adige founded with Ladin/Italic names?

If that is so, than the people of [[Manhatten]] are all Indians! You are following in the logic of Tolomei (Re-Italianization of Germanized names!). --[[User:Noclador|noclador]] ([[User talk:Noclador|talk]]) 14:05, 20 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::::* See, all you can really do is make accusations of Tolomei, Italianization, etc., etc.  I don't know why you can't discuss this in a civilized manner.  Instead, what my impression is, is that any hint of a non-pure German history in Bolzano-Bozen is very offensive to you, and that you lose control of yourself.  As I mentioned before, you are making yourself do what Mussolini and Tolomei were interested in doing, but in just another direction.  Do you honestly feel good about that?  So, tell me this, since \"Italians\" are only in Bolzano-Bozen from 1919+, who are the people who are in Trentino?  Are they Italians in your same definition?  Do all Italians originate in Naples?  Or do you realize that most of Trentino spoke Ladin dialects up until the establishment of Standard Italian as a ''national'' language?  For example, Nones (Val di Non), Solardo (Val di Sol), on and on and on, are all Ladin languages.  The languages of South East Switzerland (Romansch), of Trentino AND Alto Adige/South Tyrol (Ladin), and East over in Friuli (Furlan), are all a single family.  They are the ''Sicilian'' (etc.. etc.) of this region, and pre-date both Italian (Tuscan) and German.  So if you really want to play games, I say we get rid of the Italianization that happened and ''also'' the Germanization!  ROFLOL.  ps. so I take it ''not'' blonde/blue eyes.. I kinda figured.  I'll tell you if you ask why, but it isn't a pleasant critique. :) [[User:Icsunonove|Icsunonove]] ([[User talk:Icsunonove|talk]]) 20:29, 20 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n* Also, while the Germanic tribes started to come into the former Roman Republic many, many centuries past, if you look at the history of the village names in Alto Adige/South Tyrol, you may realize that many were ''Germanized'' only just a few centuries ago.  [[Kaltern an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Kaltern]] is one, in 800-900AD it was the Ladin Caldar or Caldare, the German settlers called it Kaltern.  [[Neumarkt, Italy|Neumarkt]] is another, its local name was actually Enna or Egna -- it was subsequently ''Germanized'' as the \"New Market\" by the newly arrived Germanic settlers around the 14th century.  Do I dislike this Germanization of the town's name?  No, it is part of the history of this region -- IT IS ALL GOOD.  It is still Egna in the local Romance languages though, no matter what you hope to do.  Then [[Eppan an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Eppan]], which was in Ladin Appian or Apiano from 500AD; Eppan is a loaned word that was Germanized, much like the word Bozen or Botzen.  [[Merano]], is Meran/Maran in Ladin for centuries.  It is borrowed and used in German, but it is '''not''' a German word.  [[Terlan]] has been ''Terlan'' in Ladin for centuries.  It is borrowed and used in German, but it is '''not''' a German word.  If you want to complete your re-Germanization, you need to invent some new words for these, ok?  That is again why I have always INSISTED that we respect all the names and history of this region.  If it is easier for you to believe that the area is a \"pure\" German entity, and would like to wish all the other history away, good for you.  But, all you do is become a Tolomei of this era, and appear now to be intent on re-Germanization and wiping out the roots of this wonderful region.  So, you can come here again yelling and ranting, and making accusations of Italianization and Mussolini, it doesn't matter to me.  My roots in this area are probably '''much''' further back than yours, and I am proud to have Roman and Austrian heritage.  I will never try to trivialize this region by attempting to shove some aspects of the history out.  What you appear unable to take, is any aspect that spoils your dream of Alto Adige/South Tyrol being PURE German.  That is a pretty miserable need, and I do implore you to be more open minded.  [[User:Icsunonove|Icsunonove]] ([[User talk:Icsunonove|talk]]) 20:15, 20 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n* and lastly Noclador, what did I ever do to you to deserve these vile attacks?  Because I was fixing wikilinks from [[South Tyrol]] to [[Province of Bolzano-Bozen]]?  There was nothing at all wrong with the edits I made on those radio pages, I indeed fixed the links to point to the proper pages like the Austrian state of Tyrol.  Or is it that I dare ask you to look a bit deeper into the history of this region, to realize it isn't so black-and-white?  Hmm?  I've never once asked for any German names to disappear or for only Italian (Tuscan) to be used... <u>never</u>.  So, the impression I have for now is either 1) you are HYPER-sensitive, and go after someone fixing wikilinks assuming some dire conspiracy, or 2) you somehow have an inner need to yell to the World this area is purely German.  Please, do prove me wrong.  If you simply misunderstood my intentions because of the bridge page, that is fine, then chill the hell out.  If you look back at those edits, I only wanted to cite things clearly, and as points were brought up I included them.  That you kept adding old ''Austrian province of South Tyrol'', certainly raised eyebrows for myself and others.  Think about that action.  I'm certainly somebody that if I learn for sure ''Ponte Romano'' was but a 1927 invented label for the bridge, then it means nothing culturally to me.  It is just a blip in the history.  But then other statements you make like ''all the names were German'' pre 1919 again makes my eyebrows raise, because you in one sentence disregard the real history of this region -- and that to me is unacceptable. [[User:Icsunonove|Icsunonove]] ([[User talk:Icsunonove|talk]]) 20:48, 20 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n\n:: Let us make this very simple: South Tyrol: from 600AD to 1919AD over 85% ethnic German. Italians: 3%-5% of population. Claims of multicultural South Tyrol (exception: the 2x Ladin valleys and the area south of Bozen were some thousands Italians lived) before 1920ies = myth, fable, legend, fairy tale. But you can always bring a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]] and reliable source that says otherwise. Also: whatever the roots of local names were, relevant is what the cultural circle of the people was/is: overwhelmingly Germanic (and that since the ''early'' middle ages). But of course I invite you to bring proof that it was otherwise. I\u2019m not out to \u201cshove some aspects of the history out\u201d I\u2019m about to shove the made-up history out \u2013 with all the references needed, not because I\u2019m a German nationalist ([http://toolserver.org/%7Esql/sqlbot.php?user=Noclador have a look at my \u201cTop 25 mainspace article edits\u201d]) but because your idea of the local history is distorted. No matter how often you repeat it: there is no historical basis for many of your claims. Over the next weeks I will edit all the history in, with all sources and references. Afterwards the articles will be much more detailed, neutral, broader in scope and most importantly accurate, referenced and sourced. Good - right? --[[User:Noclador|noclador]] ([[User talk:Noclador|talk]]) 23:22, 20 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n::: First of all, you had better never imply that I have purposely added any made-up history.  I'll assume for now you were not trying to do so.  :)  So, wait, you think it is a myth and fairly tale that there were pre-Germanic people living in villages which have Ladin names that predate by a millennia the mass migration of Germanic people into this region?   Wow! :)  That is indeed a pretty quick shoveling out of what are irrefutable facts.  Who named and founded the villages, garden gnomes?  I was afraid you would do this as well, but you completely ignored many of the valid points I made about the greater extent of the Ladin language, the origins of the people just a few thousand meters away in Trentino, Switzerland, etc.  I don't have any disagreement that in the middle ages that the area, especially in the northern reaches, had significant Germanic migration (some who are relatives of me!).   What I do disagree with you is your dream that the Ladin speakers were always in just a couple pockets of Alto Adige/South Tyrol.  Many of the people who spoke Ladin, were with time, mixed into the dominant language communities (and that goes on even now); the people did not evaporate; you can see the shared features in Trentino-Alto Adige to this very day (and you know as well as I do that the region is not full of blonde people).  So sorry, many of the people are not \"pure\" ethnic Germans, and yes, the region has always always been multicultural.  But, is that so bad??  How do you think the interesting culture exists!  Also, hopefully it won't happen, but say the Romansch speaking people of Switzerland all someday speak either French, German, or Italian, is that their new ethnicity?? Hmm??  By the way, did you ever realize that the term Welsh in German did not originate in this area to describe modern Italian citizens?    In the original context, it referred to the Italic people of this region and just a few centuries ago it was applied to describe Ladin speakers.   So the German speakers in the middle ages, up until the 20th century, referred to Ladin speakers as ''Welsh''.   Did you ever try and put 2 and 2 together when looking at the history of a town like [[Welschnofen]]?  That town, pre-middle ages, was ''Nova'' in Ladin, so where do you think the German '''Welsch'''nofen might come from?  Is that rocket science?  Of course in this day and age the city is primarily German speaking.  Again, does that specify ethnicity?  No. Someone told me that the people in Val Gardena start to speak more German than Ladin.  Makes sense, since German is a major commercial language.  Are they morphing into \"pure\" ethnic Germans?  No.  Again with Welschnofen, would you prefer to believe that is was simply founded by a band of \"pure\" Germans, and they called it Welschnofen because when they were migrating they had actually dreamt of making it all the way down to Capri? :P  Give me a break Noclador.  It is difficult for me to fully believe you are not biased towards a hyper-Germanic view when it seems I can upset you by pointing out that Terlan and Meran are not German names, and that even Bozen and Botzen are Germanized words of the names used by the original inhabitants.  Why is that so hard to deal with?  It is our SHARED history and culture.  The Germans NOR the Ladins grew out of the soil, we all migrated here one way or another.  Look, speck is brought to us by German thinking mixed with Italic.  I'd never try to claim it one way or the other, I LOVE the fact that is not one or the other.  Anyway, you'd make a good step if you realized I'm not trying to refute you really, I'm trying to make you realize things are richer than they are.  If I point out to you that Meran is not a German word, and comes from the Ladin people here originally, this does not mean anyone wants to de-Germanize or throw anyone out.  Got it??  @_@  [[User:Icsunonove|Icsunonove]] ([[User talk:Icsunonove|talk]]) 01:12, 21 January 2009 (UTC)\n:::: No reply Noclador? =)  I'm sure you haven't given up yet on the \"pure German\" view and Italian history only from the last century...

You have proven my point again and again that you are fearful of anything that shows the Province of Bolzano to not be purely German.   That said, I must say you being from Merano provides a certain grand satisfaction with regard to the irony that this name is not, nor ever will be of German origin.  Every time you say Meran, you will in fact be saying a Ladin word, a word of a people you would like to dream never existed in this area.  In the end you are simply doing EXACTLY the same thing you accuse the fascists and Tolomei of doing a century ago; so I hope you do enjoy your company.

The area has been settled by German populations since than.\"  I don't know how much clearer it has to be that this is a Germanic city.  The article says the city was settled by German populations since the year 679.  The article also says \"At the time of its annexation {after WW I}, Bozen was an ethnic German city, with a pre-war population of 30,000 people, 95.52% of whom were German native speakers.\"   Also, Bozen was part of the German speaking country of Austria for how long?  Over a millenia?  Also, the reason Wikipedia refers to the city as Bolzano is not because Bolzano is the English name of the city.  All English language encyclopedia's will refer to  Bolzano and all other cities that were formerly German by the name the country they are now part of calls them.  This goes for hundreds of cities taken from Germany and Austria since the end of  WW I (Pilsen now PLZEN - Czech, Bozen now Bolzano - Italian, Danzig now Gdansk - Poland, Breslau now Wroclaw - Poland).  Your attempts to deny the German history of this city are disgusting.  Unfortunately, when it comes to anything German wikipedia will always be opposed to the German (and Austrian) point of view.  Also, English is a Germanic language - derived from German.  So, the the word Bolzano is used for the reason I explained above.  \n\nIn addition, Italy is a beautiful country, but its not an accident that Bolzano or (Bozen) has the second highest standard of living in Italy.  When the worlds best cities (ranked by standard of living) are published in magazines, there are typically 3 to 5 German speaking cities ranked in the top ten cities in the world (Zurich, Vienna, Munich).  No other country has more than one city ranked in the top ten:  The USA, the UK, France and Italy each don't have any cities that rank in the top ten.\n\nYou are biased, just as most of the wikipedia editors are.

Italian expressions are translated verbatim and as a result the English page reads awkward and unconvincing. Although I`ve edited several paragraphs that had been written and published with numerous English language issues, I believe that the article still needs major revisions, both with regard to contents and to English terminology and grammar.\n\n:Hello, I've reverted your edits as, unfortunately, they contained errors and were undiscussed. You talked about a war between Austria and Italy in 2015. No doubt a typo, but indicative of the changes. More seriously, you changed some statements that came from sources, which is not allowed. I agree with you about the need to improve the article, but please do so through careful editing and by discussing with other editors. [[User:Jeppiz|Jeppiz]] ([[User talk:Jeppiz|talk]]) 15:35, 11 September 2015 (UTC)+\n\nSPECIFIC ISSUES IN THE CANCELLATION BY JEPPIZ:\n\n``No fighting took place in the County of Tyrol during the First World War.``\nJeppiz claims that this statement is supported by the cited source. That is impossible. He failed to evaluate the source and double check whether the statement respects the source. The Tyrolean front line was over 400 Km long and there were thousands of casualties in battles fought all along the Tyrolean borders, with tens of war cemeteries built to bury the dead. You can easily find evidence of the absurdity of the statement\n\n``Nevertheless, those Germans who opted to stay in South Tyrol ....` Jeppiz wrongly reverted to this version. Inhabitants of South Tyrol are not Germans, although they speak German. Jeppiz reverted to a clearly inaccurate version without investigating my changes.\n\nENTIRE PARAGRAPH ``In the 1920s, along with the rest of South Tyrol, Bolzano was subjected to an intensive [[Italianization of South Tyrol|Italianisation programme]].........`` Jeppiz erased all my changes, for no reason. I had edited the paragraph to improve readability, grammar and English language issues, accuracy (the previous paragraph spoke of `those Germans` whereas historically South Tyroleans were not Germans, although they spoke German. The paragraph was poorly written and I made changes to improve that.\n\n`` After 1943, heavy fighting against Nazi Germany and the Axis Powers took place in the [[Dolomite]] Alps once the Allied Powers had liberated Italy.`` Jeppiz mistakenly reverted to this version. He made two mistakes: First, there is no such thing as the Dolomite Alps. They are called DOLOMITES, or, likely acceptable in English, Dolomitic Alps. Second, the statement is virtually impossible. The Allied troops could not have fought in the Dolomites after Italy had been liberated, because the Dolomites are in Italy and therefore the statement is nonsensical. My reinstated version ameliorated both points.\n\n`` independence movements gradually gained popularity among the Germanic population in Bolzano and South Tyrol.` Jeppiz cl,early has no knowledge of local history and erased my ALL comments based on dubious reasons. In this case, I had improved the narrative by erasing the word `gradually` since the local population had overwhelmingly sought re-unification with Austria. My other changes, erased by Jeppiz, were meant to improve readability, since the pre-existing paragraph was poorly written. Jeppiz deemed my changes to be worth of his ax.\n\n``In 1996, the European Union approved of further integration of the Austrian state of [[Tyrol (State)|Tyrol]] with the Germanic province of South Tyrol and [[Trentino]] (''Welschtirol'') in Italy.``  Jeppiz incorrectly reverted to this version which shows two inaccuracies: 1) Tyrol is not an Austrian state; it`s an Austrian province (Land and not Staat). 2)South Tyrol is not a Germanic province. In 1996 it was an Italian bilingual autonomous province. My correction was accurate and needed no axing.  <small class=\"autosigned\">\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.151.117.48|62.151.117.48]] ([[User talk:62.151.117.48|talk]]) 18:37, 11 September 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\nI don`t know who you are, but evidently you play god with someone else`s work. The fact that you erased all my changes and reverted back to the original ``No fighting took place in the County of Tyrol during the First World War.`` proves your inadequacy as whatever your role is. There were thousands of casualties in battles fought all along the Tyrolean borders, with tens of war cemeteries built to bury the dead. You can easily find evidence of the absurdity of the statement that you re-installed by virtue of a power position,  instead of using your knowledge of the themes discussed in the article. Before you intervene to defend a mediocre wiki page in need of thorough revisions, you should assess the validity of its contents, not just publish something just because ONE very questionable source is cited. How about evaluating the source? Did you do that? I can assure you that a source stating that no fighting happened in Tyrol is bogus, the same as saying that no fighting happened in Normandy during WWII. The Tyrolean front line was over 400 Km long, but that of course doesn`t count, because you decided that the `source` of the citation is valid. That would not get you a C on a freshman`s history essay. Furthermore, your comments are offensive and unsubstantiated, when, aside from blaming me for a typo that you could have fixed without much fuss, you imply that I made errors. Which ones? You didn`t elaborate; you just used your censorial ax and reverted EVERYTHING to a version filled with inaccuracies and language mistakes while, by your own admission, you ``agree... about the need to improve the article.`` If you recognize that need, since you play the expert`s role, why didn`t you say where and how the article should be improved? Your kind of editorial work must be very fulfilling - for you, but serves no purpose in terms of accuracy and readability. Wikipedia is a project written by informed people with a good attitude and openness towards learning. Where do you stand on that? Whatever your answer, it won`t matter to me, because I don`t subscribe to communication built on prevarication, which apparently you enjoy.  I won`t engage. Good luck.\n\n:Thank you for your comment, but I encourage you to comment on content, not on other editors. Please read [[WP:NPA]]. Wikipedia is not about being right, it's about accurately representing reliable sources. Apart from the personal attacks on me, your reply largely consists of arguments that you're right and the sources wrong, therefore you can change what the sources say. That is absolutely forbidden, and a form of vandalism. If a source is wrong, and can be proven to be wrong '''by using better sources''', then we can always remove a source. However, changing the text while keeping the same sources is to misrepresent them, and that is definitely not allowed. Once again, I encourage you to engage constructively and impassionately by discussing with other users. As a general rule, if somebody undoes your changes, you should ''first'' discuss and reach a [[WP:CONSENSUS]] ''before'' reinstating the changes ([[WP:BRD]]). Last but not least, you don't have the option not to engage with other users on Wikipedia. It's a collective project, and nobody is above discussing with others.

I said  that I was not going to engage WITH JEPPIZ because he is not discussing anything. He is simply imposing his censorship without any knowledge of the content he is censoring and without addressing my comments and changes on their merit. Therefore I am not engaging with Jeppiz. He is acting out of a position of self-avowed power behind the pretentious claim that he is following Wiki guidelines. I have explained in details why Jeppiz` censorial cuts were wrong, mainly because Jeppiz didn`t act constructively - like he implies, failing to verify whether the many inconsistencies in the articles were actually supported by the sources that he is so adamantly defending. Jeppiz failed to act responsibly as an editor and didn`t consider the merit of my comments. Had he done that, he would have found out that THE CITED SOURCES DID NOT SUPPORT THE STATEMENTS I critiqued in my comments. Before accusing others of vandalism, jeppiz needs to develop the necessary self-analitic skills to ensure that he will no longer overstep his role by censoring someone else`s work without any knowledge of the subject, which jeppiz clearly lacks. Again, I am writing this for other users, as I find it of little value to engage with someone who is not even reading my full changes and comments and is unable to address them in a professional manner.  <small class=\"autosigned\">\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.151.117.48|62.151.117.48]] ([[User talk:62.151.117.48|talk]]) 00:17, 12 September 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\nMy opinion: The newly written version seems to me clearly better and removes factual inaccuracies.

I'd like to discuss whether this is appropriate in English. According to MOS:BOLDALTNAMES, bolded alternative names are for commonly used English-language equivalents, like Bombay for Mumbai.\n\nThe sources provided for Bozen are:\n*Ertl, Thomas (2017). \"Land Transactions in and around Bozen (South Tirol) in the Mid-Thirteenth Century\". \u2013 This is a historical source; it mentions Bozen, but in a scholarly historical context.\n*[https://www.cerme14.it/how-to-get-to-bozen-bolzano/ University of Bolzano \u2013 Travel info] \u2013 This shows that the university uses the double naming, but this seems to be a localized, institution-specific usage, not general English usage.\n*[https://www.south-tirol.com/culture-holidays-south-tyrol/cultural-attractions/bozen-environs South-Tyrol.com \u2013 Cultural Attractions] \u2013 A tourist site, likely automatically translated; not necessarily reflective of English usage.\n\nI am not aware of any widespread use of Bozen in English-language sources outside of these niche or historical contexts. In my view, this might not meet the threshold of an \u201cEnglish alternative name\u201d as required by [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES]].\n\nCould we discuss whether it should remain bolded, or perhaps just mentioned in text or as a note?\n\nThanks!

I'm afraid you might be overestimating public interest in this exciting topic :-)\n:I could've chosen better references, apologies for that, but I would stand by both names - while not suggesting that \"Bozen\" has parity in English usage with \"Bolzano\", there is enough there (remember, Bolzano itself isn't super well-known).\n:The historical aspect is one consideration, as the name would appear more in old texts, but mainly, from what I see, nowadays there are institutions like the university or Bozen Baroque Orchestra, whose English names use that name and are frequently mentioned by default by many people, so it would be strange ''not'' to give it as an alternative name, basically. Using Google (sorry for using Google for examples), \"University of Bolzano\" has about 170 results, \"University of Bozen\" 180*, and yes, I know it's \"Bozen-Bolzano\", no one is disputing that. \"Province of Bozen\" has 90, \"Province of Bolzano\" 200 - certainly a majority, but both are names that people seem to be choosing to use in English, if that makes sense.\n:About the IPA, I... didn't find it cluttered but opinions can differ.

However, when deciding whether to '''bold''' an alternative name in the lead, we should follow [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES]] strictly, which sets a fairly high threshold.\n\n::The guideline says:\n\n:::> \"Alternative names in English or that have significant English-language usage may be given in bold in the lead section.\"  \n:::> (see [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES#Alternative names]])\n\n::and also clarifies:\n\n:::> \"Do not bold names in other languages unless they are '''commonly used in English'''.\"  \n:::> (same section, emphasis added)\n\n::The key phrase here is '''\"in English\"''' or '''\"English-language usage.\"'''  \n::The examples given in the Manual of Style \u2014 ''Bombay'' for ''Mumbai'', ''Florence'' for ''Firenze'', ''Peking'' for ''Beijing'' \u2014 are all **recognized English exonyms**, not simply local or institutional bilingual forms.\n\n::By contrast, ''Bozen'' appears almost exclusively in contexts that reflect '''local bilingualism''' rather than independent English usage. The name is used by bilingual institutions (e.g. the ''Free University of Bozen\u2013Bolzano'') and in tourism materials that often reproduce South Tyrolean bilingual terminology, but that does not make ''Bozen'' an English-language alternative any more than ''Meran'', ''Brixen'', or ''Trst'' are considered English names for ''Merano'', ''Bressanone'', or ''Trieste''.\n\n::The [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES]] guideline is explicit that the purpose of bolding is to help readers recognize \"alternative English names\" \u2014 not merely to list local variants or translations. Including ''Bozen'' in bold therefore gives an inaccurate impression that English has two coequal forms, which is not supported by reliable English-language sources.\n\n::Regarding the Google results you mentioned: simple hit counts from search engines can be misleading because they often reflect machine-translated, automatically indexed, or locally produced content. What matters is usage in '''independent English-language publications''' \u2014 for example, encyclopedias, academic works in English, or major English-language newspapers. In those, ''Bolzano'' overwhelmingly predominates, while ''Bozen'' appears mainly in quotations or in the context of local institutions.\n\n::For that reason, I suggest the following compromise, which aligns with MOS and also reflects the bilingual context:\n\n:::* Keep ''Bozen'' mentioned in the first sentence, e.g. \"Bolzano (German: ''Bozen'') is \u2026\"  \n:::* Remove the bold formatting from ''Bozen'', since it is not an established English alternative name.\n\n::This is consistent with how other South Tyrolean and bilingual European cities are handled (e.g. ''Merano'' (German: ''Meran''), ''Aosta'' (French: ''Aoste''), ''Brussels'' (French: ''Bruxelles''; Dutch: ''Brussel'')), none of which bold the local-language equivalents.\n\n::Thanks again for engaging constructively on this \u2014 I think this small adjustment would make the article both clearer and fully compliant with [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES]].\n\n::-- [[User:Simoncik84|Simoncik84]] ([[User talk:Simoncik84|talk]]) 24 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n:::I'd rather you edit-warred than posted all that stuff, Simoncik, good grief ([[WP:Wikilawyering]]).

The syntax \u201cBolzano (German: ''Bozen'')\u201d with bold is permitted only if Bozen meets that English-language threshold, which is exactly what we are discussing here. This is why comparative examples like Merano/Meran should also be evaluated based on the same criteria \u2014 we cannot assume local usage equals English usage.\n::::I also note that similar behavior has been raised on your own talk page: prior discussions indicate a pattern of trying to impose personal preferences over MOS guidance. While we can all make mistakes, this reinforces why it\u2019s important to stick to policy and independent sources rather than personal judgment.\n::::Finally, I ask that we keep this discussion civil and policy-based. Personal judgments about what I should or should not post are not appropriate on Wikipedia. We can continue to analyze Bozen/Bolzano in light of MOS and reliable sources, without ad hominem commentary.  \n::::-- [[User:Simoncik84|Simoncik84]] ([[User talk:Simoncik84|talk]]) 25 October 2025 (UTC) [[User:Simoncik84|Simoncik84]] ([[User talk:Simoncik84|talk]]) 11:18, 3 November 2025 (UTC)\n:::::Hi [[User:1RightSider|1RightSider]], since no consensus was reached in the discussion on this page, and some changes were made to the lead without agreement, I have requested a neutral third opinion at [[WP:3O]] regarding the use of \"Bozen\" in the lead.

[[User:JPG-GR|JPG-GR]] ([[User talk:JPG-GR|talk]]) 05:57, 30 April 2008 (UTC)\n\nAccording to the traffic stats [http://stats.grok.se/en/200802/Bolzano here] and [http://stats.grok.se/en/200802/Bernard_Bolzano here], the article for the city ([[Bolzano]]) receives about twice as much traffic as the article for the person ([[Bernard Bolzano]]) which is certainly ''more'', but not (I think) so ''overwhelmingly'' more that the city qualifies as a primary usage for the name \"Bolzano\" (and the various disputes <s>above</s> ''[[/Archive 1|in the archive]]'' over the proper name for the city simply underscores this fact.)\n\nI propose that the article on the city be moved to [[Bolzano (city)]] and that [[Bolzano]] be made a redirect to [[Bolzano (disambiguation)]] (or the disambiguation page moved here.)  --[[User:Sapphic|Sapphic]] ([[User talk:Sapphic|talk]]) 21:55, 25 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n*'''Strongly oppose''' That's what headers are for; this one required expansion. If there are two principal articles likely to be searched for as ''Bolzano'', we don't make ''everybody'' click twice, when we can let half of them get where they want to go immediately. [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] <small>[[User talk:Pmanderson|PMAnderson]]</small> 22:38, 25 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n*'''Oppose''' - the redirect header is sufficient. The Italian name for the city is the primary usage in English (especially since the \"Pass\" is always used in that way). People looking for the person will find him without problem the was it is, whilst the city will get lost in a plethora of related usages. --[[User:Stomme|Stomme]] ([[User talk:Stomme|talk]]) 23:29, 25 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n*<s>'''Incredibly, super-strongly support with extra powerful support that beats all other kinds of opposition, in virtue of its strongness'''</s> Disambiguation pages are meant to organize topics, not cut down on the number of clicks.  As for primary usage, this passage from [[WP:D]] is relevant:\n\n::'''Primary topic'''\n::When there is a well known primary meaning for a term or phrase, much more used than any other (this may be indicated by a majority of links in existing articles or by consensus of the editors of those articles that it will be significantly more commonly searched for and read than other meanings), then that topic may be used for the title of the main article, with a disambiguation link at the top. If there's a disambiguation page, it should link back to the primary topic.\n::If there is extended discussion about which article truly is the primary topic, that may be a sign that there is in fact no primary topic, and that the disambiguation page should be located at the plain title with no \"(disambiguation)\".\n\n:As for which usage is primary in English, I'd say that's far from decided.  The article on the city receives about twice the traffic as the article on the person, and has about four times the number of incoming links &mdash; but a search on google or yahoo (ignoring Wikipedia page results) turns up results for the person before the city.  So Wikipedia seems to favor the city, but the web as a whole favors the person as the primary usage for the name.  Since \"Bolzano\" isn't even agreed upon as the proper name in English (see the various past arguments in the [[/Archive 1|talk archive]]) I don't see how it is at all a settled matter.  (BTW, putting \"strongly\" in front of support/opposition is silly.)  --[[User:Sapphic|Sapphic]] ([[User talk:Sapphic|talk]]) 00:08, 26 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n:* '''Oppose''' Given the obvious lack of consensus for a move, and given a few more days to think about the issue and to try to think how the rest of you could be so obviously wrong yet think you're right, I've decided that you are, in fact, right.  The way I think about it now that makes sense to me is that [[Bolzano]] should only be ''at most'' a '''redirect''' to [[Bernard Bolzano]], and would never be the canonical name for the article on the person.  However, [[Bolzano]] is ''currently'' the canonical name for the article on the city.  So, given a conflict, the article on the city gets priority, and a hat note (already added by [[User:PMAnderson]], thank you!).   '''However''' &mdash; and here is where I think I perhaps still differ from the others in the discussion &mdash; if this were a case of redirect vs. redirect or canonical name vs. canonical name, I think we would be obliged to have [[Bolzano]] either ''be'' or ''redirect to'' the disambiguation page.  This is an important point to consider, if the name of the article ever changes (again) and [[Bolzano]] is again turned into a redirect.  Anyway, I thank everyone involved for helping to sort out this issue.  --[[User:Sapphic|Sapphic]] ([[User talk:Sapphic|talk]]) 21:33, 28 April 2008 (UTC)\n::<small>p.s.

I looked only at English pages, and removed Bernard and Bernardo from both searches to eliminate, in balance, any pages about the mathemetician. I also ignored Wikipedia, to keep our own pages from influencing the numbers: For \"bolzano -bozen -bernard -bernardo -wikipedia\" I get 298,000 pages, and for \"bozen -bolzano -bernard -bernardo -wikipedia\" I get 118,000 pages. That's a bit over twice as much for the Italian name, in English. And actually, all the previous search show is that the word \"city\" probably occurs on more German pages than Italian, since the search wasn't limited to English. A Google search as before, but only including English still favours Bolzano (although the person probably influences the numbers somewhat): 'Bolzano city' gives 452,000 and 'Bozen city' gives 98,000. While I am more than happy to call the city Bozen myself, for the English Wikipedia Bolzano is the proper name based on common usage and naming conventions. I also maintain my previous vote to oppose based on the fact that [[Bernard Bolzano]] already has a disambiguation in his name (Bernard) and changing the article to [[Bolzano (city)]] will just mean a lot of unnecessary piping and link maintenance (no links to the person should be referring to him by last name only if the MOS is followed). And I fear that this discussion will soon no longer be about separating the city from the person, but from separating the German and the Italian sides (again). --[[User:Stomme|Stomme]] ([[User talk:Stomme|talk]]) 08:56, 28 April 2008 (UTC)\n::::(You get Matthead's results searching for \"bolzano city\" and \"bozen city\" without quotation marks)--'''[[User:Supparluca|<span style=\"color:green;\">Suppar</span>]][[User talk:Supparluca|<span style=\"color:red;\">luca</span>]]''' 09:18, 28 April 2008 (UTC)\n::: Actually, my search is without quotation marks; I had used single quotes in my previous comment hoping to eliminate the ambiguity.

I'll just come on here to state that the sentence claiming Bolzano was an ethnic German city, because 95% spoke German, is bogus.  Mother tongue does not equal ethnicity, sorry to break it to you.  My mother tongue is English, I am not English. Jean Alessi's mother tongue is French, he is not French.  You all completely pass over the fact that the people of Trentino Alto Adige were essentially all Ladin speakers at one point, until the German language along with some ethnic Germans migrated and mixed into this area.  There are people all over the province of Bolzano with dark hair and features, having surnames like Seppi, or Rainer, (two names I know go back for centuries in Bolzano) who speak the German language because it was under a German-speaking crown.  duh!  Of course these same families likely have mixed roots of German, maybe some people from Veneto, Friuli, whatever.  The point is that the great thing about this region is this mixture, and all you seem intent on doing is making it trivial.  I don't know how many times I have to explain this to the group who think this area was simply some ''purely'' German \"ethnic\" area that was invaded.  I guess that makes it easier to process for some people's minds... @_@  [[User:Icsunonove|Icsunonove]] ([[User talk:Icsunonove|talk]]) 09:46, 19 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n:: You are mistaken: The multi-ethnic Austrian Empire explicitly asked the ethnicity of the people and not the language! 95,5% declared them to be ''German''! The statement is referenced - it is a publication by the city of Bolzano! also: there are just 326 people named Seppi in the entire province [http://qlikview.provincia.bz.it/bnarc/Webform2.aspx] and 1512 Rainer, but than Rainer is a GERMAN name [[Rainer]] - so rightly there are lots of them in the province. --[[User:Noclador|noclador]] ([[User talk:Noclador|talk]]) 09:57, 19 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n::: So you like names - for you they prove the ethnicity of person; ''GOOD'' here is the list with the 120 most common names in the province of Bolzano 2004 - to make it easier for you I highlighted the 2 Italian and the 4 Ladin ones [http://img158.imageshack.us/img158/4430/namesnq1.png in Green and Blue: ] - and saved myself the work to highlight the ''114 German'' ones! --[[User:Noclador|noclador]] ([[User talk:Noclador|talk]]) 10:50, 19 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::* Noclador, I'm seriously concerned you are going to have a stroke. =)  Please, relax, and when you do, we obviously can discuss this better.  I don't say I'm right about everything, you might want to consider that it may be healthy for yourself to look at this with an open mind as well.  By the way, there are quite a few Rainer in Trentino as well; do you want to notify them they are \"ethnic\" Germans? :)  I've told you before, you continue to insist on making things ''black and white'', yet they are not, nor will ever be.  If you don't want to accept that the region is not made up of some singular and pure ethnicity, that is up to you -- it doesn't matter to me really.  I know people who speak Ladino dialects, yet when asked they identify them as dialects of Italian (Tuscan).  Point being?  Asking everyday people does not result in necessarily real results.  Of course many people who spoke German at that time will call themselves \"German\", but what do you think happened to the original Ladin and Latin speakers of this region before Germanic people migrated down here a few centuries ago?  They evaporated?  My point is that the people of Trentino-Alto Adige ARE Germanic, but they are also Italic... and they are Ladino-dolomiten, and they are Roman, and they are Etruscan.  How long as your family been in Trentino-Alto Adige Noclador?  Are you blonde and blue eyes with a jaw like Michael Schumacher?   Somehow, I'm willing to bet the answer is NO.  Lastly, let me pose to you two questions: 1)  Who in fact are the \"Italians\"?  and 2) Why were the vast majority of towns in Alto Adige founded with Ladin/Italic names?

If that is so, than the people of [[Manhatten]] are all Indians! You are following in the logic of Tolomei (Re-Italianization of Germanized names!). --[[User:Noclador|noclador]] ([[User talk:Noclador|talk]]) 14:05, 20 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::::* See, all you can really do is make accusations of Tolomei, Italianization, etc., etc.  I don't know why you can't discuss this in a civilized manner.  Instead, what my impression is, is that any hint of a non-pure German history in Bolzano-Bozen is very offensive to you, and that you lose control of yourself.  As I mentioned before, you are making yourself do what Mussolini and Tolomei were interested in doing, but in just another direction.  Do you honestly feel good about that?  So, tell me this, since \"Italians\" are only in Bolzano-Bozen from 1919+, who are the people who are in Trentino?  Are they Italians in your same definition?  Do all Italians originate in Naples?  Or do you realize that most of Trentino spoke Ladin dialects up until the establishment of Standard Italian as a ''national'' language?  For example, Nones (Val di Non), Solardo (Val di Sol), on and on and on, are all Ladin languages.  The languages of South East Switzerland (Romansch), of Trentino AND Alto Adige/South Tyrol (Ladin), and East over in Friuli (Furlan), are all a single family.  They are the ''Sicilian'' (etc.. etc.) of this region, and pre-date both Italian (Tuscan) and German.  So if you really want to play games, I say we get rid of the Italianization that happened and ''also'' the Germanization!  ROFLOL.  ps. so I take it ''not'' blonde/blue eyes.. I kinda figured.  I'll tell you if you ask why, but it isn't a pleasant critique. :) [[User:Icsunonove|Icsunonove]] ([[User talk:Icsunonove|talk]]) 20:29, 20 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n* Also, while the Germanic tribes started to come into the former Roman Republic many, many centuries past, if you look at the history of the village names in Alto Adige/South Tyrol, you may realize that many were ''Germanized'' only just a few centuries ago.  [[Kaltern an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Kaltern]] is one, in 800-900AD it was the Ladin Caldar or Caldare, the German settlers called it Kaltern.  [[Neumarkt, Italy|Neumarkt]] is another, its local name was actually Enna or Egna -- it was subsequently ''Germanized'' as the \"New Market\" by the newly arrived Germanic settlers around the 14th century.  Do I dislike this Germanization of the town's name?  No, it is part of the history of this region -- IT IS ALL GOOD.  It is still Egna in the local Romance languages though, no matter what you hope to do.  Then [[Eppan an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Eppan]], which was in Ladin Appian or Apiano from 500AD; Eppan is a loaned word that was Germanized, much like the word Bozen or Botzen.  [[Merano]], is Meran/Maran in Ladin for centuries.  It is borrowed and used in German, but it is '''not''' a German word.  [[Terlan]] has been ''Terlan'' in Ladin for centuries.  It is borrowed and used in German, but it is '''not''' a German word.  If you want to complete your re-Germanization, you need to invent some new words for these, ok?  That is again why I have always INSISTED that we respect all the names and history of this region.  If it is easier for you to believe that the area is a \"pure\" German entity, and would like to wish all the other history away, good for you.  But, all you do is become a Tolomei of this era, and appear now to be intent on re-Germanization and wiping out the roots of this wonderful region.  So, you can come here again yelling and ranting, and making accusations of Italianization and Mussolini, it doesn't matter to me.  My roots in this area are probably '''much''' further back than yours, and I am proud to have Roman and Austrian heritage.  I will never try to trivialize this region by attempting to shove some aspects of the history out.  What you appear unable to take, is any aspect that spoils your dream of Alto Adige/South Tyrol being PURE German.  That is a pretty miserable need, and I do implore you to be more open minded.  [[User:Icsunonove|Icsunonove]] ([[User talk:Icsunonove|talk]]) 20:15, 20 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n* and lastly Noclador, what did I ever do to you to deserve these vile attacks?  Because I was fixing wikilinks from [[South Tyrol]] to [[Province of Bolzano-Bozen]]?  There was nothing at all wrong with the edits I made on those radio pages, I indeed fixed the links to point to the proper pages like the Austrian state of Tyrol.  Or is it that I dare ask you to look a bit deeper into the history of this region, to realize it isn't so black-and-white?  Hmm?  I've never once asked for any German names to disappear or for only Italian (Tuscan) to be used... <u>never</u>.  So, the impression I have for now is either 1) you are HYPER-sensitive, and go after someone fixing wikilinks assuming some dire conspiracy, or 2) you somehow have an inner need to yell to the World this area is purely German.  Please, do prove me wrong.  If you simply misunderstood my intentions because of the bridge page, that is fine, then chill the hell out.  If you look back at those edits, I only wanted to cite things clearly, and as points were brought up I included them.  That you kept adding old ''Austrian province of South Tyrol'', certainly raised eyebrows for myself and others.  Think about that action.  I'm certainly somebody that if I learn for sure ''Ponte Romano'' was but a 1927 invented label for the bridge, then it means nothing culturally to me.  It is just a blip in the history.  But then other statements you make like ''all the names were German'' pre 1919 again makes my eyebrows raise, because you in one sentence disregard the real history of this region -- and that to me is unacceptable. [[User:Icsunonove|Icsunonove]] ([[User talk:Icsunonove|talk]]) 20:48, 20 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n\n:: Let us make this very simple: South Tyrol: from 600AD to 1919AD over 85% ethnic German. Italians: 3%-5% of population. Claims of multicultural South Tyrol (exception: the 2x Ladin valleys and the area south of Bozen were some thousands Italians lived) before 1920ies = myth, fable, legend, fairy tale. But you can always bring a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]] and reliable source that says otherwise. Also: whatever the roots of local names were, relevant is what the cultural circle of the people was/is: overwhelmingly Germanic (and that since the ''early'' middle ages). But of course I invite you to bring proof that it was otherwise. I\u2019m not out to \u201cshove some aspects of the history out\u201d I\u2019m about to shove the made-up history out \u2013 with all the references needed, not because I\u2019m a German nationalist ([http://toolserver.org/%7Esql/sqlbot.php?user=Noclador have a look at my \u201cTop 25 mainspace article edits\u201d]) but because your idea of the local history is distorted. No matter how often you repeat it: there is no historical basis for many of your claims. Over the next weeks I will edit all the history in, with all sources and references. Afterwards the articles will be much more detailed, neutral, broader in scope and most importantly accurate, referenced and sourced. Good - right? --[[User:Noclador|noclador]] ([[User talk:Noclador|talk]]) 23:22, 20 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n::: First of all, you had better never imply that I have purposely added any made-up history.  I'll assume for now you were not trying to do so.  :)  So, wait, you think it is a myth and fairly tale that there were pre-Germanic people living in villages which have Ladin names that predate by a millennia the mass migration of Germanic people into this region?   Wow! :)  That is indeed a pretty quick shoveling out of what are irrefutable facts.  Who named and founded the villages, garden gnomes?  I was afraid you would do this as well, but you completely ignored many of the valid points I made about the greater extent of the Ladin language, the origins of the people just a few thousand meters away in Trentino, Switzerland, etc.  I don't have any disagreement that in the middle ages that the area, especially in the northern reaches, had significant Germanic migration (some who are relatives of me!).   What I do disagree with you is your dream that the Ladin speakers were always in just a couple pockets of Alto Adige/South Tyrol.  Many of the people who spoke Ladin, were with time, mixed into the dominant language communities (and that goes on even now); the people did not evaporate; you can see the shared features in Trentino-Alto Adige to this very day (and you know as well as I do that the region is not full of blonde people).  So sorry, many of the people are not \"pure\" ethnic Germans, and yes, the region has always always been multicultural.  But, is that so bad??  How do you think the interesting culture exists!  Also, hopefully it won't happen, but say the Romansch speaking people of Switzerland all someday speak either French, German, or Italian, is that their new ethnicity?? Hmm??  By the way, did you ever realize that the term Welsh in German did not originate in this area to describe modern Italian citizens?    In the original context, it referred to the Italic people of this region and just a few centuries ago it was applied to describe Ladin speakers.   So the German speakers in the middle ages, up until the 20th century, referred to Ladin speakers as ''Welsh''.   Did you ever try and put 2 and 2 together when looking at the history of a town like [[Welschnofen]]?  That town, pre-middle ages, was ''Nova'' in Ladin, so where do you think the German '''Welsch'''nofen might come from?  Is that rocket science?  Of course in this day and age the city is primarily German speaking.  Again, does that specify ethnicity?  No. Someone told me that the people in Val Gardena start to speak more German than Ladin.  Makes sense, since German is a major commercial language.  Are they morphing into \"pure\" ethnic Germans?  No.  Again with Welschnofen, would you prefer to believe that is was simply founded by a band of \"pure\" Germans, and they called it Welschnofen because when they were migrating they had actually dreamt of making it all the way down to Capri? :P  Give me a break Noclador.  It is difficult for me to fully believe you are not biased towards a hyper-Germanic view when it seems I can upset you by pointing out that Terlan and Meran are not German names, and that even Bozen and Botzen are Germanized words of the names used by the original inhabitants.  Why is that so hard to deal with?  It is our SHARED history and culture.  The Germans NOR the Ladins grew out of the soil, we all migrated here one way or another.  Look, speck is brought to us by German thinking mixed with Italic.  I'd never try to claim it one way or the other, I LOVE the fact that is not one or the other.  Anyway, you'd make a good step if you realized I'm not trying to refute you really, I'm trying to make you realize things are richer than they are.  If I point out to you that Meran is not a German word, and comes from the Ladin people here originally, this does not mean anyone wants to de-Germanize or throw anyone out.  Got it??  @_@  [[User:Icsunonove|Icsunonove]] ([[User talk:Icsunonove|talk]]) 01:12, 21 January 2009 (UTC)\n:::: No reply Noclador? =)  I'm sure you haven't given up yet on the \"pure German\" view and Italian history only from the last century...

That said, I must say you being from Merano provides a certain grand satisfaction with regard to the irony that this name is not, nor ever will be of German origin.  Every time you say Meran, you will in fact be saying a Ladin word, a word of a people you would like to dream never existed in this area.

The area has been settled by German populations since than.\"  I don't know how much clearer it has to be that this is a Germanic city.  The article says the city was settled by German populations since the year 679.  The article also says \"At the time of its annexation {after WW I}, Bozen was an ethnic German city, with a pre-war population of 30,000 people, 95.52% of whom were German native speakers.\"   Also, Bozen was part of the German speaking country of Austria for how long?  Over a millenia?  Also, the reason Wikipedia refers to the city as Bolzano is not because Bolzano is the English name of the city.  All English language encyclopedia's will refer to  Bolzano and all other cities that were formerly German by the name the country they are now part of calls them.  This goes for hundreds of cities taken from Germany and Austria since the end of  WW I (Pilsen now PLZEN - Czech, Bozen now Bolzano - Italian, Danzig now Gdansk - Poland, Breslau now Wroclaw - Poland).  Your attempts to deny the German history of this city are disgusting.  Unfortunately, when it comes to anything German wikipedia will always be opposed to the German (and Austrian) point of view.  Also, English is a Germanic language - derived from German.  So, the the word Bolzano is used for the reason I explained above.  \n\nIn addition, Italy is a beautiful country, but its not an accident that Bolzano or (Bozen) has the second highest standard of living in Italy.  When the worlds best cities (ranked by standard of living) are published in magazines, there are typically 3 to 5 German speaking cities ranked in the top ten cities in the world (Zurich, Vienna, Munich).  No other country has more than one city ranked in the top ten:  The USA, the UK, France and Italy each don't have any cities that rank in the top ten.\n\nYou are biased, just as most of the wikipedia editors are.

Italian expressions are translated verbatim and as a result the English page reads awkward and unconvincing.

You talked about a war between Austria and Italy in 2015. No doubt a typo, but indicative of the changes. More seriously, you changed some statements that came from sources, which is not allowed. I agree with you about the need to improve the article, but please do so through careful editing and by discussing with other editors.

That is impossible. He failed to evaluate the source and double check whether the statement respects the source. The Tyrolean front line was over 400 Km long and there were thousands of casualties in battles fought all along the Tyrolean borders, with tens of war cemeteries built to bury the dead. You can easily find evidence of the absurdity of the statement\n\n``Nevertheless, those Germans who opted to stay in South Tyrol ....` Jeppiz wrongly reverted to this version. Inhabitants of South Tyrol are not Germans, although they speak German. Jeppiz reverted to a clearly inaccurate version without investigating my changes.\n\nENTIRE PARAGRAPH ``In the 1920s, along with the rest of South Tyrol, Bolzano was subjected to an intensive [[Italianization of South Tyrol|Italianisation programme]].........`` Jeppiz erased all my changes, for no reason. I had edited the paragraph to improve readability, grammar and English language issues, accuracy (the previous paragraph spoke of `those Germans` whereas historically South Tyroleans were not Germans, although they spoke German. The paragraph was poorly written and I made changes to improve that.\n\n`` After 1943, heavy fighting against Nazi Germany and the Axis Powers took place in the [[Dolomite]] Alps once the Allied Powers had liberated Italy.`` Jeppiz mistakenly reverted to this version. He made two mistakes: First, there is no such thing as the Dolomite Alps. They are called DOLOMITES, or, likely acceptable in English, Dolomitic Alps. Second, the statement is virtually impossible. The Allied troops could not have fought in the Dolomites after Italy had been liberated, because the Dolomites are in Italy and therefore the statement is nonsensical. My reinstated version ameliorated both points.\n\n`` independence movements gradually gained popularity among the Germanic population in Bolzano and South Tyrol.` Jeppiz cl,early has no knowledge of local history and erased my ALL comments based on dubious reasons. In this case, I had improved the narrative by erasing the word `gradually` since the local population had overwhelmingly sought re-unification with Austria. My other changes, erased by Jeppiz, were meant to improve readability, since the pre-existing paragraph was poorly written. Jeppiz deemed my changes to be worth of his ax.\n\n``In 1996, the European Union approved of further integration of the Austrian state of [[Tyrol (State)|Tyrol]] with the Germanic province of South Tyrol and [[Trentino]] (''Welschtirol'') in Italy.``  Jeppiz incorrectly reverted to this version which shows two inaccuracies: 1) Tyrol is not an Austrian state; it`s an Austrian province (Land and not Staat). 2)South Tyrol is not a Germanic province. In 1996 it was an Italian bilingual autonomous province. My correction was accurate and needed no axing.  <small class=\"autosigned\">\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.151.117.48|62.151.117.48]] ([[User talk:62.151.117.48|talk]]) 18:37, 11 September 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\nI don`t know who you are, but evidently you play god with someone else`s work. The fact that you erased all my changes and reverted back to the original ``No fighting took place in the County of Tyrol during the First World War.`` proves your inadequacy as whatever your role is. There were thousands of casualties in battles fought all along the Tyrolean borders, with tens of war cemeteries built to bury the dead. You can easily find evidence of the absurdity of the statement that you re-installed by virtue of a power position,  instead of using your knowledge of the themes discussed in the article. Before you intervene to defend a mediocre wiki page in need of thorough revisions, you should assess the validity of its contents, not just publish something just because ONE very questionable source is cited. How about evaluating the source? Did you do that? I can assure you that a source stating that no fighting happened in Tyrol is bogus, the same as saying that no fighting happened in Normandy during WWII. The Tyrolean front line was over 400 Km long, but that of course doesn`t count, because you decided that the `source` of the citation is valid. That would not get you a C on a freshman`s history essay. Furthermore, your comments are offensive and unsubstantiated, when, aside from blaming me for a typo that you could have fixed without much fuss, you imply that I made errors. Which ones? You didn`t elaborate; you just used your censorial ax and reverted EVERYTHING to a version filled with inaccuracies and language mistakes while, by your own admission, you ``agree... about the need to improve the article.`` If you recognize that need, since you play the expert`s role, why didn`t you say where and how the article should be improved? Your kind of editorial work must be very fulfilling - for you, but serves no purpose in terms of accuracy and readability. Wikipedia is a project written by informed people with a good attitude and openness towards learning. Where do you stand on that? Whatever your answer, it won`t matter to me, because I don`t subscribe to communication built on prevarication, which apparently you enjoy.  I won`t engage. Good luck.\n\n:Thank you for your comment, but I encourage you to comment on content, not on other editors. Please read [[WP:NPA]]. Wikipedia is not about being right, it's about accurately representing reliable sources. Apart from the personal attacks on me, your reply largely consists of arguments that you're right and the sources wrong, therefore you can change what the sources say. That is absolutely forbidden, and a form of vandalism. If a source is wrong, and can be proven to be wrong '''by using better sources''', then we can always remove a source. However, changing the text while keeping the same sources is to misrepresent them, and that is definitely not allowed. Once again, I encourage you to engage constructively and impassionately by discussing with other users. As a general rule, if somebody undoes your changes, you should ''first'' discuss and reach a [[WP:CONSENSUS]] ''before'' reinstating the changes ([[WP:BRD]]). Last but not least, you don't have the option not to engage with other users on Wikipedia. It's a collective project, and nobody is above discussing with others.

I said  that I was not going to engage WITH JEPPIZ because he is not discussing anything. He is simply imposing his censorship without any knowledge of the content he is censoring and without addressing my comments and changes on their merit. Therefore I am not engaging with Jeppiz. He is acting out of a position of self-avowed power behind the pretentious claim that he is following Wiki guidelines. I have explained in details why Jeppiz` censorial cuts were wrong, mainly because Jeppiz didn`t act constructively - like he implies, failing to verify whether the many inconsistencies in the articles were actually supported by the sources that he is so adamantly defending. Jeppiz failed to act responsibly as an editor and didn`t consider the merit of my comments. Had he done that, he would have found out that THE CITED SOURCES DID NOT SUPPORT THE STATEMENTS I critiqued in my comments. Before accusing others of vandalism, jeppiz needs to develop the necessary self-analitic skills to ensure that he will no longer overstep his role by censoring someone else`s work without any knowledge of the subject, which jeppiz clearly lacks. Again, I am writing this for other users, as I find it of little value to engage with someone who is not even reading my full changes and comments and is unable to address them in a professional manner.  <small class=\"autosigned\">\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.151.117.48|62.151.117.48]] ([[User talk:62.151.117.48|talk]]) 00:17, 12 September 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\nMy opinion: The newly written version seems to me clearly better and removes factual inaccuracies.

I'd like to discuss whether this is appropriate in English. According to MOS:BOLDALTNAMES, bolded alternative names are for commonly used English-language equivalents, like Bombay for Mumbai.\n\nThe sources provided for Bozen are:\n*Ertl, Thomas (2017). \"Land Transactions in and around Bozen (South Tirol) in the Mid-Thirteenth Century\". \u2013 This is a historical source; it mentions Bozen, but in a scholarly historical context.\n*[https://www.cerme14.it/how-to-get-to-bozen-bolzano/ University of Bolzano \u2013 Travel info] \u2013 This shows that the university uses the double naming, but this seems to be a localized, institution-specific usage, not general English usage.\n*[https://www.south-tirol.com/culture-holidays-south-tyrol/cultural-attractions/bozen-environs South-Tyrol.com \u2013 Cultural Attractions] \u2013 A tourist site, likely automatically translated; not necessarily reflective of English usage.\n\nI am not aware of any widespread use of Bozen in English-language sources outside of these niche or historical contexts. In my view, this might not meet the threshold of an \u201cEnglish alternative name\u201d as required by [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES]].\n\nCould we discuss whether it should remain bolded, or perhaps just mentioned in text or as a note?\n\nThanks!

I'm afraid you might be overestimating public interest in this exciting topic :-)\n:I could've chosen better references, apologies for that, but I would stand by both names - while not suggesting that \"Bozen\" has parity in English usage with \"Bolzano\", there is enough there (remember, Bolzano itself isn't super well-known).\n:The historical aspect is one consideration, as the name would appear more in old texts, but mainly, from what I see, nowadays there are institutions like the university or Bozen Baroque Orchestra, whose English names use that name and are frequently mentioned by default by many people, so it would be strange ''not'' to give it as an alternative name, basically. Using Google (sorry for using Google for examples), \"University of Bolzano\" has about 170 results, \"University of Bozen\" 180*, and yes, I know it's \"Bozen-Bolzano\", no one is disputing that. \"Province of Bozen\" has 90, \"Province of Bolzano\" 200 - certainly a majority, but both are names that people seem to be choosing to use in English, if that makes sense.\n:About the IPA, I... didn't find it cluttered but opinions can differ.

However, when deciding whether to '''bold''' an alternative name in the lead, we should follow [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES]] strictly, which sets a fairly high threshold.\n\n::The guideline says:\n\n:::> \"Alternative names in English or that have significant English-language usage may be given in bold in the lead section.\"  \n:::> (see [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES#Alternative names]])\n\n::and also clarifies:\n\n:::> \"Do not bold names in other languages unless they are '''commonly used in English'''.\"  \n:::> (same section, emphasis added)\n\n::The key phrase here is '''\"in English\"''' or '''\"English-language usage.\"'''  \n::The examples given in the Manual of Style \u2014 ''Bombay'' for ''Mumbai'', ''Florence'' for ''Firenze'', ''Peking'' for ''Beijing'' \u2014 are all **recognized English exonyms**, not simply local or institutional bilingual forms.\n\n::By contrast, ''Bozen'' appears almost exclusively in contexts that reflect '''local bilingualism''' rather than independent English usage. The name is used by bilingual institutions (e.g. the ''Free University of Bozen\u2013Bolzano'') and in tourism materials that often reproduce South Tyrolean bilingual terminology, but that does not make ''Bozen'' an English-language alternative any more than ''Meran'', ''Brixen'', or ''Trst'' are considered English names for ''Merano'', ''Bressanone'', or ''Trieste''.\n\n::The [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES]] guideline is explicit that the purpose of bolding is to help readers recognize \"alternative English names\" \u2014 not merely to list local variants or translations. Including ''Bozen'' in bold therefore gives an inaccurate impression that English has two coequal forms, which is not supported by reliable English-language sources.\n\n::Regarding the Google results you mentioned: simple hit counts from search engines can be misleading because they often reflect machine-translated, automatically indexed, or locally produced content. What matters is usage in '''independent English-language publications''' \u2014 for example, encyclopedias, academic works in English, or major English-language newspapers. In those, ''Bolzano'' overwhelmingly predominates, while ''Bozen'' appears mainly in quotations or in the context of local institutions.\n\n::For that reason, I suggest the following compromise, which aligns with MOS and also reflects the bilingual context:\n\n:::* Keep ''Bozen'' mentioned in the first sentence, e.g. \"Bolzano (German: ''Bozen'') is \u2026\"  \n:::* Remove the bold formatting from ''Bozen'', since it is not an established English alternative name.\n\n::This is consistent with how other South Tyrolean and bilingual European cities are handled (e.g. ''Merano'' (German: ''Meran''), ''Aosta'' (French: ''Aoste''), ''Brussels'' (French: ''Bruxelles''; Dutch: ''Brussel'')), none of which bold the local-language equivalents.\n\n::Thanks again for engaging constructively on this \u2014 I think this small adjustment would make the article both clearer and fully compliant with [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES]].\n\n::-- [[User:Simoncik84|Simoncik84]] ([[User talk:Simoncik84|talk]]) 24 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n:::I'd rather you edit-warred than posted all that stuff, Simoncik, good grief ([[WP:Wikilawyering]]). It's not that important. You began with the assumption that Bolzano had only one name, and it's colouring your views and how you're treating the topic. Just as Bolzano is not only an Italian name, Bozen is not only a German name, it's clearly an English name in certain contexts, some of which are in those independent publications you cited with no evidence. Its historical importance alone indicates significance (presumably it was the main English name until 1920). Brussels is irrelevant, Aosta is an \"Other Stuff Exists\" argument, and the [[Merano]] article '''does have the two town names are bolded'''.\n\n:::Literally ''only'' to end this discussion, I'll change Bozen to be bolded in brackets per its English use, but please just leave off from this discussion now. Thank you. [[User:1RightSider|1RightSider]] ([[User talk:1RightSider|talk]]) 07:26, 25 October 2025 (UTC)\n:::Hi 1RightSider,  \n::::I need to respond firmly on a few points regarding your last message.  \n::::First, per [[WP:DISCUSS]], all editors have the right to participate in discussions about content, and no editor may unilaterally decide what is \u201cimportant\u201d or dismiss another editor\u2019s concerns. If you personally feel a topic is unimportant, you are free to abstain, but that does not prevent others from discussing it.  \n::::Second, your comment \"I'd rather you edit-warred\" raises a serious concern: intentionally or jokingly encouraging an edit war is explicitly prohibited by [[WP:EDITWAR]] and is considered disruptive conduct. Please refrain from such suggestions.  \n::::Third, regarding bolded alternative names: according to [[MOS:BOLDALTNAMES]], bolding in the lead is only for English-language alternative names with significant usage. It does not automatically apply to any bilingual or historical form. The syntax \u201cBolzano (German: ''Bozen'')\u201d with bold is permitted only if Bozen meets that English-language threshold, which is exactly what we are discussing here. This is why comparative examples like Merano/Meran should also be evaluated based on the same criteria \u2014 we cannot assume local usage equals English usage.\n::::I also note that similar behavior has been raised on your own talk page: prior discussions indicate a pattern of trying to impose personal preferences over MOS guidance. While we can all make mistakes, this reinforces why it\u2019s important to stick to policy and independent sources rather than personal judgment.\n::::Finally, I ask that we keep this discussion civil and policy-based. Personal judgments about what I should or should not post are not appropriate on Wikipedia. We can continue to analyze Bozen/Bolzano in light of MOS and reliable sources, without ad hominem commentary.  \n::::-- [[User:Simoncik84|Simoncik84]] ([[User talk:Simoncik84|talk]]) 25 October 2025 (UTC) [[User:Simoncik84|Simoncik84]] ([[User talk:Simoncik84|talk]]) 11:18, 3 November 2025 (UTC)\n:::::Hi [[User:1RightSider|1RightSider]], since no consensus was reached in the discussion on this page, and some changes were made to the lead without agreement, I have requested a neutral third opinion at [[WP:3O]] regarding the use of \"Bozen\" in the lead.

Specifically, they are insisting that the following items be added to or remain in the \"In media and popular culture\" section:\n* The graduation scene in the 1970 movie ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' was filmed at City College.<ref>IMDB[Love Story [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066011/locations/?ref_=tt_dt_loc]</ref>\n* In 2018, the penultimate episode of ''[[The Americans]]'' (season 6, episode 9) was filmed at City College.<ref>IMDB [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6268292/?ref_=ttep_ep9]</ref>\n* In Woody Allen's 1971 film [[Bananas (film)|Bananas]], Nancy, the love interest of the central character Fielding Melish, is a philosophy major at City College.<ref>IMDB  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066808/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1]</ref>\n* The 1984 movie ''[[Beat Street]]'' was partially filmed at City College, which features a dance audition at [[Aaron Davis Hall]] as part of the story. <ref>IMDB [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086946/]</ref>\n\nFirst, it's unacceptable for Iss246 to edit war to add or keep these items in the article. This is not their own personal article in which they wield a veto over all other editors.\n\nSecond, these are trivial facts that do little to help readers understand this institution. [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE|Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and our [[WP:UNIGUIDE|advice on college and university articles]] has specific guidance what should be included in sections like this: \"[It] should '''not''' be an indiscriminate list of instances where the college or university is mentioned (in movies, books, television shows, etc.) nor should the section offer examples and discussion [[WP:OR|selected only by Wikipedia editors]].\" There are other items included in this section that are helpful for readers - these are not.\n\nThird, IMDB is not a reliable source. It's been discussed so many times that it has [[WP:IMDB|a specific entry]] in our list of commonly-discussed sources which in turn links to an [[Wikipedia:Citing IMDb|essay]] that goes into more detail. [[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] ([[User talk:ElKevbo|talk]]) 18:57, 16 December 2023 (UTC)\n\n:Thank you.  I fully agree.  These are summary articles, and should not be burdened with such minor points, as details that CCNY was backdrop in a movie, or that such-and-such a building is LEEDS certified.  Puffery and trivia bloat on these articles is a constant problem.  [[User:Jax MN|Jax MN]] ([[User talk:Jax MN|talk]]) 19:39, 16 December 2023 (UTC)\n::I also agree that these popular-culture mentions can't remain in the article and should be removed (I would do it myself if I didn't have a COI with the City University of New York, as I've mentioned in a previous section). However\u2014with regards to your point about buildings, Jax MN\u2014I do think there is an argument for splitting out the buildings into their own articles, where info such as LEED certification ''would'' be DUE. At least some of the buildings, such as those on the North Campus, are noteworthy enough to be designated as [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnM7nPb43DoC&pg=PA343 historical landmarks]. &ndash; [[User:Epicgenius|Epicgenius]] ([[User talk:Epicgenius|talk]]) 00:53, 17 December 2023 (UTC)\n{{reftalk}}\n\n:::What is with the snobbery about popular culture? I have two points to make in this regard.\n\n:::First, IMDb is not as error-prone as you assert it to be. The Wikipedia article on IMDb indicates that submissions undergo consistency checks by the staff before text is published to the Web. As with Wikipedia, there is a volume of information to be checked, and therefore delays between when an item of information is submitted and when it appears. Occasional mistakes are \"inevitable,\" but readers and staff members underline the mistakes. Staff members correct mistakes. In some respects, IMDb is comparable to Wikipedia in that there are contributions and checking by users. But unlike Wikipedia there is a paid editorial staff.\n\n:::Second, popular culture references are important. Philip Kay wrote a doctoral dissertation at Columbia on the place of City College in the popular imagination. Sure, the location of City College in high culture is important. Of course that idea applies to City College's relation to books like Irving Howe's ''World of Our Fathers''. The location of City College in popular culture is also important. It tells us about the relation of the institution to the surrounding world, even for individuals who haven't read Howe's masterwork. That the college shows up in movies and TV is important too. It is of interest that Fielding Melish's love interest studies philosophy at City College. It tells us about the character. And it tells us about City College in the popular imagination.

It's what drives the constant fretting over school ratings in their Wikipedia articles, and the minutiae of reporting ''exactly'' their number of Nobel laurates, etc. Then we get to the deep dive into popular culture and every effort to chisel in the IMPORTANT FACT that Woody Allen sneezed here, or to note a particular window of a campus building wherein in the backstory of a secondary character of a novel (a NYT bestseller, no doubt!), brooding Sheila sat in ''that very campus building'' and assessed her dubious life choices up until then. Or that a particular CCNY building was [[Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]] in the third panel of a Zippy cartoon from a Sunday in early June, 2005. It is so predictably neurotic.  Loveable, even.

City College did not impose a quota system on members of ethnic groups. Irving Howe's book is thus important with respect to City College and the aspirations of Jewish youth. The documentary film called the ''Five Demands'' covers an inflection point in the history of City College. It was one of the harbingers of the Open Admissions experiment that changed City College and other units of the City University of New York (see the WP entry on [[Mina P. Shaughnessy]]). What the participants in this discussion also miss is that City College was once an educational beacon for many New Yorkers, particularly Jewish New Yorkers.

First, every time I make an edit and Graywalls makes an edit, we don't have to have a discussion on the talk page. If every time either of made an edit we had a discussion on the talk page, the talk page would be ten miles longer than the encyclopedia page. Second, I gave a justification second time I made the edit referencing the movie. I mentioned in my justification of the edit that the cachet of CCNY reflected in its being mentioned in a feature film such as ''Three Days of the Condor''.

CCNY benefits from proximity to prolific writers and artists: some established, and some at the birth of their careers.  That, and a selection of lovely buildings and vantage points make it a natural location for movies and cultural phenomena.  But Cachet?  To me, that word deems the college to have ''even more'' cultural importance, and more unique cultural importance, than it warrants.  \n:::::In general, I like this article.  The historical and architectural sections, divided by eras, seem appropriate for this school even if long.  The academic section is appropriate from the perspective of balance.  The list of notables is reasonable, and over time has been off-loaded to a secondary article. (The school has had a goodly number of bright lights.)  The mention of the short-lived 2024 protest camp (Palestinian issue) is overblown, and likely won't stand the test of time, regarding its inclusion since these were so common, yet transitory (looming peace deal, at this writing) - it may be better to spin off a subsection for protests over the years especially if CCNY student activism sparked movements nationwide. As it stands now, the mention of cultural events is interwoven in the main body text, in the history section. If you find a secondary source to note how CCNY pops up as a persistent filming location in events of the broader culture, that would be defensible - surely there is a secondary source analysis of this phenomena, but you might wrap other such cultural incidents into that section, moving them into a combined section. I tend to be an inclusionist, as we continue to expand Wikipedia articles.  But be careful about a NY-centric bias or bloat.

The difference of opinion concerns is not about the source. The difference of opinion concerns the description of the honors program at City College. Like honors programs at other colleges, the honors program at City College provides for free tuition. Unlike other honors programs, the City College program also gives its students something like a passport that provides them access to many New York City's cultural institutions, for example, museums, Broadway theaters, etc. In my view, that access to cultural institutions is unique among honors programs. It is important enough feature of the honors program that it is worth mentioning on the City College of New York entry to the encyclopedia.

Specifically, they are insisting that the following items be added to or remain in the \"In media and popular culture\" section:\n* The graduation scene in the 1970 movie ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' was filmed at City College.<ref>IMDB[Love Story [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066011/locations/?ref_=tt_dt_loc]</ref>\n* In 2018, the penultimate episode of ''[[The Americans]]'' (season 6, episode 9) was filmed at City College.<ref>IMDB [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6268292/?ref_=ttep_ep9]</ref>\n* In Woody Allen's 1971 film [[Bananas (film)|Bananas]], Nancy, the love interest of the central character Fielding Melish, is a philosophy major at City College.<ref>IMDB  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066808/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1]</ref>\n* The 1984 movie ''[[Beat Street]]'' was partially filmed at City College, which features a dance audition at [[Aaron Davis Hall]] as part of the story. <ref>IMDB [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086946/]</ref>\n\nFirst, it's unacceptable for Iss246 to edit war to add or keep these items in the article. This is not their own personal article in which they wield a veto over all other editors.\n\nSecond, these are trivial facts that do little to help readers understand this institution. [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE|Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and our [[WP:UNIGUIDE|advice on college and university articles]] has specific guidance what should be included in sections like this: \"[It] should '''not''' be an indiscriminate list of instances where the college or university is mentioned (in movies, books, television shows, etc.) nor should the section offer examples and discussion [[WP:OR|selected only by Wikipedia editors]].\" There are other items included in this section that are helpful for readers - these are not.\n\nThird, IMDB is not a reliable source. It's been discussed so many times that it has [[WP:IMDB|a specific entry]] in our list of commonly-discussed sources which in turn links to an [[Wikipedia:Citing IMDb|essay]] that goes into more detail. [[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] ([[User talk:ElKevbo|talk]]) 18:57, 16 December 2023 (UTC)\n\n:Thank you.  I fully agree.  These are summary articles, and should not be burdened with such minor points, as details that CCNY was backdrop in a movie, or that such-and-such a building is LEEDS certified.  Puffery and trivia bloat on these articles is a constant problem.  [[User:Jax MN|Jax MN]] ([[User talk:Jax MN|talk]]) 19:39, 16 December 2023 (UTC)\n::I also agree that these popular-culture mentions can't remain in the article and should be removed (I would do it myself if I didn't have a COI with the City University of New York, as I've mentioned in a previous section). However\u2014with regards to your point about buildings, Jax MN\u2014I do think there is an argument for splitting out the buildings into their own articles, where info such as LEED certification ''would'' be DUE. At least some of the buildings, such as those on the North Campus, are noteworthy enough to be designated as [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnM7nPb43DoC&pg=PA343 historical landmarks]. &ndash; [[User:Epicgenius|Epicgenius]] ([[User talk:Epicgenius|talk]]) 00:53, 17 December 2023 (UTC)\n{{reftalk}}\n\n:::What is with the snobbery about popular culture? I have two points to make in this regard.\n\n:::First, IMDb is not as error-prone as you assert it to be. The Wikipedia article on IMDb indicates that submissions undergo consistency checks by the staff before text is published to the Web. As with Wikipedia, there is a volume of information to be checked, and therefore delays between when an item of information is submitted and when it appears. Occasional mistakes are \"inevitable,\" but readers and staff members underline the mistakes. Staff members correct mistakes. In some respects, IMDb is comparable to Wikipedia in that there are contributions and checking by users. But unlike Wikipedia there is a paid editorial staff.\n\n:::Second, popular culture references are important. Philip Kay wrote a doctoral dissertation at Columbia on the place of City College in the popular imagination. Sure, the location of City College in high culture is important. Of course that idea applies to City College's relation to books like Irving Howe's ''World of Our Fathers''. The location of City College in popular culture is also important. It tells us about the relation of the institution to the surrounding world, even for individuals who haven't read Howe's masterwork. That the college shows up in movies and TV is important too. It is of interest that Fielding Melish's love interest studies philosophy at City College. It tells us about the character. And it tells us about City College in the popular imagination. [[User:Iss246|Iss246]] ([[User talk:Iss246|talk]]) 04:08, 17 December 2023 (UTC)\n::::We aren't  \"asserting\" anything about IMDb; the community consensus is that it's generally unreliable, and this is listed at [[WP:RSP#IMDb]]. If you would like to have that changed, you are free to start a discussion at [[WP:RSN]]. However, the current consensus among the Wikipedia community, again, is that IMDb is ''not'' generally reliable and should be supplanted by a source which actually is reliable.{{Pb}}Second, I don't think there is a need to list out all of CCNY's pop-culture appearances. As @[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] said above, \"our [[Wikipedia:UNIGUIDE|advice on college and university articles]] has specific guidance what should be included in sections like this: \"[It] should '''not''' be an indiscriminate list of instances where the college or university is mentioned (in movies, books, television shows, etc.) nor should the section offer examples and discussion [[Wikipedia:OR|selected only by Wikipedia editors]].\" We can, at best, summarize the pop-culture appearances, ''if'' they are significant. But we should ''not'' be including every single movie where CCNY serves as a backdrop, or every single book where CCNY is mentioned; merely summarizing that info is sufficient to \"tells us about City College in the popular imagination\", as you say.

My sense is that the protagonist in this discussion is yoked to a very predictable response among fans of the Ivys or of certain old-line east coast schools, like CCNY. No offense intended, but it is a self-absorption that is endemic among this milieu. (And I say this as as someone who enjoys Manhattan, and how direct New Yorkers are.) It's what drives the constant fretting over school ratings in their Wikipedia articles, and the minutiae of reporting ''exactly'' their number of Nobel laurates, etc. Then we get to the deep dive into popular culture and every effort to chisel in the IMPORTANT FACT that Woody Allen sneezed here, or to note a particular window of a campus building wherein in the backstory of a secondary character of a novel (a NYT bestseller, no doubt!), brooding Sheila sat in ''that very campus building'' and assessed her dubious life choices up until then. Or that a particular CCNY building was [[Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]] in the third panel of a Zippy cartoon from a Sunday in early June, 2005. It is so predictably neurotic.  Loveable, even.  But we denizens of fly-over country laugh, and New Yorkers cannot perceive the joke. It's. A. Summary. Article.  \n::::::::If {{U|Iss246}} wishes to write a book, authoritatively listing the nexus points of all popular culture incidents where fame, fortune and CCNY meet, have at it.  There may be an audience for it.  But that is not here, in a limited, introductory, summary article about CCNY. [[User:Jax MN|Jax MN]] ([[User talk:Jax MN|talk]]) 17:17, 18 December 2023 (UTC)\n:::::::::I don't know what the fuck you are talking about.

In the spirit of the season, I'd love to buy you a drink next time you are here.  I have a favorite bourbon that has won 7 best-in-class medals, is certified organic, endorsed by two A-listers and is carbon-neutral with featured placement in an upcoming movie... So there's that. Either Minneapolis or St. Paul will be fine. On the larger point, let these summary articles remain as launch pads for further research, without shoehorning in every darn point.  Again, I think there may be a market for ''When Woody Allen walked these mean streets - CCNY in the popular imagination, 1920-2020.'' I'd even  write a blurb for the jacket. Run with it, Iss! [[User:Jax MN|Jax MN]] ([[User talk:Jax MN|talk]]) 22:39, 18 December 2023 (UTC)\n:::::::::::You run with it. Run with the sarcasm dripping from your lips. [[User:Iss246|Iss246]] ([[User talk:Iss246|talk]]) 05:11, 19 December 2023 (UTC)\n::::::::::::(Another holiday party last night...) Actually, that was a drop of bourbon on my lower lip, but thanks for noticing.  Golly Iss, I even tried to find common ground for our proposed Twin Cities cocktail, noting the wealth of cultural affirmations or endorsements that my bourbon choice had earned. These apparently are validating ... for people. --Me, I just like the bourbon, and am not a \"labels chaser.\"  CCNY is important in its own right, and the cultural nexus points cannot gild the lily any further. Rather, they can appear to be a thinly-veiled effort to resuscitate the purported \"importance\" of an otherwise fading film or dusty book, ''only benefiting the film or book'' by way of mention, versus adding any gravitas to the school.  \n::::::::::::Let me take another tack: During the Colonial period, it was popular for various inns to declare that \"Washington once slept here!\".  I suppose your interest in linking CCNY to various cultural mention is similar in intent, but I cannot get too worked up over a 50-year old film background shot, or the resume of a minor character, or the logistics that declare Woody Allen once sneezed there. None of these rise to the importance of Geo. Washington, though perhaps opinions may diverge. I'd therefore omit all or most of the cultural mentions.  Given the range of opinions, this discussion is valuable to gain consensus, if not 100% agreement.

Now, back to this question. It seems clear to me that Iss246 has shown edit-warring behavior and is not interested in consensus, particularly since they don't take the substantial questions seriously that were raised above.

Let me go through the points one by one. 1. \"In World of Our Fathers, Irving Howe writes about Jewish immigrants' children attending City College.\" That there were/are a lot of Jews at CCNY seems to me to be really obvious and unnecessary as an additional point. 2. \"The 2023 documentary The Five Demands provides archival footage and interviews with students who led the 1969 protests at City College.\" Unless the students were protesting in some specific CCNY way, this is superfluous. 3. \"The graduation scene in the 1970 movie Love Story was filmed at City College.\" Delete, nothing to discuss. 4. \"The central character in Woody Allen's short story \"The Kugelmass Episode\" is a lovesick City College humanities professor.\" Delete for same reasons. 4. \"In 2018, the penultimate episode of The Americans (season 6, episode 9) was filmed at City College.\" Delete for the same reasons. 5. \"In Woody Allen's 1971 film Bananas, Nancy, the love interest of the central character Fielding Melish, is a philosophy major at City College.\" Utterly irrelevant. 6. \"The 1984 movie Beat Street was partially filmed at City College, which features a dance audition at Aaron Davis Hall as part of the story.\" There is no encycloopedia-relevant information here; who cares what hall was used? --[[User:Melchior2006|Melchior2006]] ([[User talk:Melchior2006|talk]]) 19:51, 21 December 2023 (UTC)\n{{od}}Not including text on Jews attending City College, particularly in an era when institutions like Harvard, Yale, and Columbia put quotas on the numbers of Jews those institutions would admit would be problematic deletion. City College did not impose a quota system on members of ethnic groups. Irving Howe's book is thus important with respect to City College and the aspirations of Jewish youth. The documentary film called the ''Five Demands'' covers an inflection point in the history of City College. It was one of the harbingers of the Open Admissions experiment that changed City College and other units of the City University of New York (see the WP entry on [[Mina P. Shaughnessy]]). What the participants in this discussion also miss is that City College was once an educational beacon for many New Yorkers, particularly Jewish New Yorkers. They also miss the institution's esteem once held in the popular imagination of New Yorkers. See Philip Kay's ''Guttersnips and 'Eliterates: City College in the Popular Imagination''. Columbia University, 2011.

(I'd have to disagree a bit with Melchior that mentioning the book is \"really obvious and unnecessary as an additional point\", but I figure he said that because, right now, the article ''only'' mentions that the book talks about Jews being at CCNY, rather than their impact.)

To me, that word deems the college to have ''even more'' cultural importance, and more unique cultural importance, than it warrants.  \n:::::In general, I like this article.  The historical and architectural sections, divided by eras, seem appropriate for this school even if long.  The academic section is appropriate from the perspective of balance.  The list of notables is reasonable, and over time has been off-loaded to a secondary article. (The school has had a goodly number of bright lights.)  The mention of the short-lived 2024 protest camp (Palestinian issue) is overblown, and likely won't stand the test of time, regarding its inclusion since these were so common, yet transitory (looming peace deal, at this writing) - it may be better to spin off a subsection for protests over the years especially if CCNY student activism sparked movements nationwide. As it stands now, the mention of cultural events is interwoven in the main body text, in the history section. If you find a secondary source to note how CCNY pops up as a persistent filming location in events of the broader culture, that would be defensible - surely there is a secondary source analysis of this phenomena, but you might wrap other such cultural incidents into that section, moving them into a combined section. I tend to be an inclusionist, as we continue to expand Wikipedia articles.  But be careful about a NY-centric bias or bloat.

As background, CUNY had placed ''all'' its doctoral programs at the Graduate Center. The Graduate Center granted all doctoral degrees. It was quite a precedent for the engineering school to break away from the Graduate Center and have CCNY grant doctoral degrees. A few years later, the clinical psychology program broke away, and once more CCNY granted another doctoral degree. All this movement was approved by the New York State Education Department.

Although there are some general comments here, I have focused primarily on the military history portions. All in all, it is very well written.\n* The Wikipedia guidelines for the lead section (the text before the table of contents) say that you should summarize the article in three or four paragraphs at the most.\n* The style we use for military biographies does not repeat the date of birth or death in the main text of the article -- they are already in the lead and in the infobox.\n* Stylistically, I would reduce the number of times you say \"participated in\" such and such battle or campaign.\n* Although colloquial usage might disagree with me, the use of \"decimated\" is not appropriate for a military history article written in a formal style.\n* The sentence beginning \"despite his older brother\" is confusing because of multiple clauses.\n* In that same sentence, you identify John Andrew by title, but the relatively unknown William Schouler does not have one; perhaps reverse the two names.\n* In \"did not see battle until May 1862\" it would be better to say combat, to avoid two uses of the word battle in the same sentence.\n* He served \"in\" the Army of the Potomac, not under it.\n* The reference to Berkeley plantation needs more context.\n* Burnside was the Army commander, but the sentence referring to him makes it sound as if he were the II Corps commander.\n* The II corps was not reassigned to Grant; it remained in the Army of the Potomac. (Grant closely supervised George G. Meade, the Army commander.)\n* I don't know that I would say \"encircled\" when referring to an individual. Surrounded?\n* We generally use the form <number> <state> Infantry, rather than regiment or Regiment.\n* Eicher (* Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher | Eicher, David J.]], ''Civil War High Commands'', Stanford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}.), p. 549, a reference that we use widely for dates and ranks, lists his resignation as January 9, 1865.\n* We frequently say \"postbellum\" instead of \"post-war\" because it is a well-known term specifically oriented toward the American Civil War.\nThese are all pretty minor, so great job. Good luck on your review. [[User:Hlj|Hal Jespersen]] ([[User talk:Hlj|talk]]) 00:17, 5 August 2009 (UTC)\n\n== [[User:Bwark|Bwark]] ([[User talk:Bwark|talk]]) Part one ==\nThanks for your request for comments. Overall, I find this article interesting and generally well written. Walker is obviously an important figure and his importance is reflected in this entry. I'll organize my comments section by section starting with the lead.\n\n'''Lead section'''\n\nI feel the lead section needs to be reorganized so that Walker's main accomplishments are mentioned in the first paragraph. His war service is less important than his statistical work on the Census, his economic theories and his presidency of M.I.T. I would suggest therefore, that you reorganize the lead so that readers will see immediately why Walker is an important figure. What are the two or three things readers need to know about him? Or to put it more colloquially, what is his main claim to fame? I would also suggest that you condense his war service so that the lead section is reduced in length from 479 words to between 350 and 400. (Note: I made a few minor edits to the lead section to correct minor glitches in spelling and grammar.)\n\n'''Background section'''\n\nI feel this section is interesting. It also gives useful background information. I have a few specific suggestions:\n* In the first paragraph, why is the reference to Holmes significant? Unless I missed it, there is no further reference to this friendship in the article. I would suggest either eliminating the mention of the Holmes family or adding something to indicate why it's significant.\n* First paragraph: \"As a boy, Walker...\" You need to mention his name here.\n* First paragraph: You might consider adding a bit more information about Walker's temper and personality. Why was his temper \"noted\" for example? There is very little in the entry to show the force of Walker's personality and it may be possible here to convey something more about Walker, the man.\n* Second paragraph: \"Beginning his schooling at the age of seven...\" \"Although he had planned to matriculate...\" and \"While he had entered with the class of '59...\" Too many sentences here in which you \"back into\" the subject. (The last two sentences appear consecutively.) They make the writing seem a bit labored.\n\n'''15th Massachusetts Volunteers section'''\n\nI'm not sure but there may be a bit too much detail here about Walker's various military rankings: \"However, the lieutenancy never materialized and Devens instead offered Walker an appointment as a sergeant major, which he assumed on August 1, 1861, after re-tailoring his previously ordered lieutenant's uniform to reflect his enlisted status. However, by September 14, 1861, Walker had been recommended by Devens and reassigned to Brig. Gen. Darius N. Couch as assistant adjutant general and promoted to captain.\" It's easy to get bogged down in this passage with its two consecutive sentences that begin with \"however\". You might consider condensing this passage. It depends on how important you feel these details are to a reader's overall understanding of Walker's military service.\n\n'''Second Army Corps section'''\n\nAn extremely interesting section! I'd suggest a few relatively minor changes.\n* I found the second sentence confusing. It begins, \"Although the II Corps later saw action...\" It's not clear to me whether Walker actually fought at Antietam and Fredericksburg. (I assume he did, but I think it needs to be stated more explicitly.) And why mention the Mud March, if Walker and II Corps had nothing to do with it?\n* The last paragraph mentions that Walker resigned his commission \"as a result of his injuries and health.\" I think more detail is needed here. His injuries are well described, but there's no information on the state of his health. I'm wondering too if any of the source material you consulted describes the effect his war experiences had on him.\n* I wonder if the information in the final paragraph of the \"Other interests\" section could be included here with some slight rewording. Something along these lines: \"Based upon his experiences in the military, Walker later published two books describing the history of the Second Army Corps (1886) as well as a biography of General Winfield Scott Hancock (1884). Walker also continued his affiliation with the military. In 1883, he was elected Commander of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and he served as President of the National Military Historical Association.\"\n\n'''Postbellum activity'''\n\nJust one minor comment. I'm not sure what you mean by \"representation\" in the last sentence. A bit more detail is needed here.\n\n'''1870 Census'''\n\nAnother highly interesting section. I have a few relatively minor editorial suggestions.\n* First paragraph: The writing is excellent up to the sentence which begins, \"Among the problems facing Walker included...\" This wording is not grammatically correct. Better to write something like: \"The problems facing Walker included...\"\n* First paragraph: I can't fully understand the sentence I refer to above. For example, I think there needs to be a fuller explanation of the marshalls' involvement as well as the influence of local political interests. I'd say a bit more information is needed to fully explain why Walker had no control over key aspects of the Census.\n* First paragraph: The last sentence needs more explanation. You appear to be referring to additional problems that Walker faced. You need to be explicit about this and you need to add something --- such as the word ''only'' --- to indicate more clearly why conducting a Census five years after the war is a problem for Walker.\n* Second paragraph: I notice that you start capitalizing ''Census'' while using lower case in the first paragraph. You need to be consistent. I think you should probably capitalize it, but I'm not absolutely sure. You might consult your source materials to see how this issue is handled.\n* Second paragraph: Not sure what you mean by ''confluence''.\n* Second paragraph: If it's possible, you might include a brief description of Walker's health problems. He seems to have been troubled by ill health all his life, yet he accomplished a great deal.\n* Second paragraph: The length of the second sentence makes it difficult to absorb all the information in it in a single reading.\n* Second paragraph: I also found the third sentence a bit too long and I had forgotten who Bowles was. There needs to be a better explanation of what you mean by \"go around.\"\n* Second paragraph: What do you mean by \"visual statistics\"? Charts and graphs or something else?\n* Second paragraph: I'm wondering why it's the ''Smithsonian Institute'' and not ''Institution''.\n* I'm wondering if material from the \"Other interests\" section could be moved to the bottom of this section. I'm referring specifically to the paragraph which begins: \"Walker also took an interest in demographics later in his career...\" I'll comment on that paragraph when I get to the \"Other interests\" section, but I do think that logically, it belongs in this section.\n\n'''Indian Bureau'''\n\n* The second sentence is too long and needs to be split into two or three shorter ones for the sake of readability. Maybe something along these lines: \"In the post-war era, the government redoubled its efforts to issue western land grants to settlers, ranchers, miners, and railroads. The new land grants heightened tensions with Native American tribes that had already been displaced from their homelands as well as stripped of their ostensible sovereignty following an 1872 act of Congress.\"\n* Not sure if it's ''chieftains'' or ''chiefs''.\n* \"Walker echoed Grant's recommendation that the Native Americans be secured on reservations of limited mineral or agricultural value so they could be educated and reformed.\" I think the idea that the reservations had limited economic value needs to be separated from the part about education and reform. Maybe something such as: \"Walker echoed Grant's recommendation that the Native Americans be secured on reservations in areas with little mining or farming potential. Once on these reservations, the Indians could be educated and reformed.\"\n* I have a couple of questions however, about the ideas in the sentences quoted immediately above. Was it just that the reservations had little in the way of minerals or agricultural value, or do you mean that the reservations were on land with few resources? What about timber for example? Depending on the facts, you may need to broaden these sentences. Maybe something like: \"Walker echoed Grant's recommendation that the Native Americans be confined to reservations on land not suitable for farming and with few resources such as minerals or timber.\" I'm also wondering if you can be more explicit about what you mean by \"reformed.\"\n* The word ''disinterest'' is contentious. It indicates impartiality, and some editors object to using it to mean ''lack of interest''.  In this case, \"lack of interest\", seems a bit understated. How specifically did the Modoc War motivate Walker to resign? For example, did the war convince him that the work of the Indian Bureau was futile?\n* Walker served as Superintendent of the Indian Bureau but he resigned his position as Commissioner. This needs clarification.\n* Last sentence: It's not clear to me whether you mean that Walker criticized his successors' graft, corruption, and abuse of power in his book ''The Indian Question''.\n\n'''Other engagements'''\n\nThe theme of this section seems to be Walker's rising prominence. Therefore, I think your headline here should reflect this in some way. \"Other engagements\" seems too vague and general. Some of this section is not about Walker's actual engagements. I'm thinking for example, of the ''Boston Post'' editorship which I assume Walker did not take. (It's not completely clear to me that he turned the job down.)\n* Second sentence: I'm not sure that you need to name Horace White and Charles Nordhoff. I think their names just add needless clutter. Since this section seems to follow chronological order, it might be useful to say when in 1876 that Walker was being recruited for the newspaper job.\n* Third sentence: I'm not sure you need the reference to the Mugwump movement. I think it would be more useful for readers if you gave a bit more detail about Walker's actual platform. (I read Wikipedia's Mugwump entry, but it didn't shed much light on Walker's political positions in the campaign you refer to here.)\n*Fourth sentence: I'd suggest slight changes for greater clarity. \"In the summer, the faculty of Amherst '''[College?]''' attempted to recruit him to become '''its''' '''p'''resident, but the position went instead to the Rev. Julius Hawley Seelye to appease conservative trustees.\"\n*Second paragraph, first sentence: Again I don't think you need to name Charles Francis Adams. Eliminating his name would also avoid the two \"bys\" that make this sentence awkward.\n* Note: I made a few edits to the rest of the second paragraph to improve flow and readability.\n\n== [[User:Bwark|Bwark]] ([[User talk:Bwark|talk]]) Part two ==\nI've split my comments and suggestions into two parts for easier editing. I'll continue discussing each of the sections in the order in which they appear in the entry.\n\n'''1880 Census'''\n\n* I would suggest re-arranging some of the sentences in this section. \n** The first sentence establishes the fact that Walker undertook the Census because of reforms spearheaded by Garfield. I feel it would be more logical to follow this sentence with the one in which you give an overview of Walker's achievement: \"The tenth Census '''which''' resulted in the publication of twenty-two volumes, was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time, and definitively established Walker's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation.\" \n** This sentence could be followed with the one discussing some potential problems: \"The Census was again delayed as a result of its size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its comprehensiveness and relevance.\" (I'm not quite sure however, what you mean by \"comprehensiveness and relevance.\" It might be necessary to explain a bit more. Do you mean for example, that this Census was praised for its comprehensiveness, but criticized because its delayed results were no longer relevant by the time they were published? Readers need to know exactly what you mean here.\n** At this point, I would suggest inserting the sentences which discuss how the 1880 Census cast a new light on Walker's earlier work. You would need to insert some kind of transition. Perhaps something along these lines: '''The improved methods used in the 1880 Census exposed discrepancies in Walker's earlier work.''' Its results suggested for example, that population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over the 1870 census. However, an investigation revealed that the earlier Census had been inaccurately enumerated. Walker publicized the discrepancy even as it effectively discredited the accuracy '''of''' his 1870 work.\" (Note: My suggested wording is far from perfect and still needs refinement. I'm assuming that the improved methods in 1880 exposed other discrepancies and that population increase in the Southern states was only one example. But that may not be accurate.)\n**I feel that the last two sentences in this section belong where they are, but I would tweak them a bit. Something like this: \"Walker also used his position '''as superintendent of the Census''' to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau. He argued such a Bureau would ensure not only that professional statisticians could be trained and retained, but that the information they gathered could be better popularized and disseminated. Following Garfield's 1880 election '''to the U.S. presidency''', there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to be Secretary of the Interior, but Walker had accepted the offer to become President of MIT in the spring of 1881 instead.\"\n\n'''Academic career'''\n\n* First sentence: by \"editorialist\" do you mean editorial writer, managing editor? You need to specify what you mean.\n* Second sentence: \"...he was unanimously offered to fill...\" This is awkward wording that also raises unanswered questions. It's not completely clear for example, what you mean by \"unanimously.\" You would need to say which body offered him this position. And I wonder if you need the two names in this sentence. The point is that Walker was offered a position at Yale and he accepted it.\n* Third sentence: \"While at Yale...\" You might signpost things for the reader by specifying how long Walker remained at Yale. For example: \"During his x years at Yale...\"\n* Second paragraph: I would suggest re-organizing this paragraph to group all the teaching appointments together. That would mean moving the last couple of sentences up to follow the ones that mention Yale. And I would suggest moving the honorary degrees to the bottom of the paragraph.\n\n== External links modified ==\nHello fellow Wikipedians,\n\nI have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Francis Amasa Walker]].

In the \"Postbellum Activity\" section of this article, within the subsection, \"Indian Bureau\", the article makes Walker seem like a native-friendly policy maker. However, Hyde writes (in 2022, page 281) \"The commissioner of Indian affairs who managed this moment [when natives were not considered US citizens] was Francis Amasa Walker, an Amherst- and Harvard- trained statistician. He laid out his plans with chilling racial logic. Indians had to be incarcerated because 'the supreme law of public safety' demanded it.  He believed so deeply in Indians as a 'beggarly, savage race ... incapable of amibition' that he argued it was unjust and un-Christian for White men to make treaties with them. Crafted in a time of unending war, White reformers named these plans of military concentration and policed reservations a Peace Policy.\" This quote makes Walker seem like a policy maker for a concentration camp style reservation system. Does anyone think this should be included somehow in the article? [[User:Smellyshirt5|Smellyshirt5]] ([[User talk:Smellyshirt5|talk]]) 16:48, 25 October 2022 (UTC)\n\n:@[[User:Smellyshirt5|Smellyshirt5]], thanks for flagging this. The [[MIT Museum]] has a bust of Walker that looks like [[:File:Francis Amasa Walker deplatformed at the MIT Museum.jpg|this]], a deplatforming so archetypal I added it to the lead of [[deplatforming]]. So it's rather shocking to see that this article currently has no mention of any sort of stain on Walker's legacy in the lead or legacy section, and it leads me to believe that there are either major updates needed since the 2009 GAN or that the review missed major neutrality issues. I'm going to tag the article for neutrality, add a sentence on the photo, and put out a call-out to [[Talk:MIT]], which I'm guessing someone interested in the topic area is watching. <span style=\"color:#AAA\"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style=\"border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088\">[[User:Sdkb|<span style=\"color:#FFF\">'''Sdkb'''</span>]]</span><small>}&#125;</small></span>\u202f<sup>[[User talk:Sdkb|'''talk''']]</sup> 08:00, 8 January 2023 (UTC)\n::The above reference by Hyde is revisionist and inconsistent with Walker's words and actions.  Regarding reservations, consider this quote by Walker: \"Nor are the interests of the Indians any better served by the existing order (reservation system). Many tribes, even were they disposed to agriculture, would not find suitable land within the limits assigned to them. Others are in a position to be incessantly disturbed and harassed by the whites. Others still, while they stand across the path of settlement, are themselves, by ill-considered treaty provisions, cut off from access to hunting-grounds, to fishing privileges, or to mountains abounding in natural roots and berries, which would be of the greatest value to them.\" P 66 of The Indian Question.  \n::Regarding his view of the natives, consider this quote: \"To assertions that the Indian cannot he civilized, can be opposed instances of Indian communities which have attained a very considerable degree of advancement in all the arts of life. To the more cautious assertion, that, while the tribes which subsist chiefly on a vegetable diet are susceptible of being tamed and improved, the meat-eating Indians, the buffalo and antelope hunters, are hopelessly intractable and savage, can be opposed instances of such tribes which, in an astonishingly short time, have been influenced to abandon the chase, to undertake agricultural pursuits, to labor with zeal and patience, to wear white man's clothes, send their children to school, attend church on Sunday, and choose their officers by ballot. To the assertion that the Indian, however seemingly reclaimed, and for a time regenerated, still retains his savage propensities and animal appetites, and will sooner or later relapse into barbarism, can be opposed instances of slow and steady growth in self-respect and self-control, extending over two generations, without an indication of the tendencies alleged. To assertions that the Indian cannot resist either physical or moral corruption by contact with the whites, that he inevitably becomes subject to the baser elements of civilized communities, that every form of infectious or contagious disease becomes doubly fatal to him, and that he learns all the vices but none of the virtues of society, can be opposed instances of tribes which have freely mingled with the whites without debasement, and have acquired the arts of civilized life with no undue proportion of its evils. To the assertion that the Indian must gradually decline in numbers and decay in strength, his life fading out before the intenser life which he encounters, can be offered instances of the steady increase in population of no small number of tribes and bands in immediate contact with settlements, and subject to the full force of white influence.\"  P52 of The Indian Question.  Or this quote: \"Upon the authority of official reports, it will doubtless appear to every candid reader that the Cherokees are entitled to be ranked among civilized communities. Their condition is far better than that of the agricultural classes of England; and they are not inferior in intelligence or in the ability to assert their rights.\" P57\n::  \n::The definitive masterwork on the relations between natives and the government is \"The Great Father\" by Prucha which says that Walker: \u201chad strong humanitarian instincts and deep concern for fair treatment of the Indians.\u201d P 584\n::This article should not have a neutrality tag over this issue.

Although there are some general comments here, I have focused primarily on the military history portions. All in all, it is very well written.\n* The Wikipedia guidelines for the lead section (the text before the table of contents) say that you should summarize the article in three or four paragraphs at the most.\n* The style we use for military biographies does not repeat the date of birth or death in the main text of the article -- they are already in the lead and in the infobox.\n* Stylistically, I would reduce the number of times you say \"participated in\" such and such battle or campaign.\n* Although colloquial usage might disagree with me, the use of \"decimated\" is not appropriate for a military history article written in a formal style.\n* The sentence beginning \"despite his older brother\" is confusing because of multiple clauses.\n* In that same sentence, you identify John Andrew by title, but the relatively unknown William Schouler does not have one; perhaps reverse the two names.\n* In \"did not see battle until May 1862\" it would be better to say combat, to avoid two uses of the word battle in the same sentence.\n* He served \"in\" the Army of the Potomac, not under it.\n* The reference to Berkeley plantation needs more context.\n* Burnside was the Army commander, but the sentence referring to him makes it sound as if he were the II Corps commander.\n* The II corps was not reassigned to Grant; it remained in the Army of the Potomac. (Grant closely supervised George G. Meade, the Army commander.)\n* I don't know that I would say \"encircled\" when referring to an individual. Surrounded?\n* We generally use the form <number> <state> Infantry, rather than regiment or Regiment.\n* Eicher (* Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher | Eicher, David J.]], ''Civil War High Commands'', Stanford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}.), p. 549, a reference that we use widely for dates and ranks, lists his resignation as January 9, 1865.\n* We frequently say \"postbellum\" instead of \"post-war\" because it is a well-known term specifically oriented toward the American Civil War.\nThese are all pretty minor, so great job. Good luck on your review. [[User:Hlj|Hal Jespersen]] ([[User talk:Hlj|talk]]) 00:17, 5 August 2009 (UTC)\n\n== [[User:Bwark|Bwark]] ([[User talk:Bwark|talk]]) Part one ==\nThanks for your request for comments. Overall, I find this article interesting and generally well written. Walker is obviously an important figure and his importance is reflected in this entry. I'll organize my comments section by section starting with the lead.\n\n'''Lead section'''\n\nI feel the lead section needs to be reorganized so that Walker's main accomplishments are mentioned in the first paragraph. His war service is less important than his statistical work on the Census, his economic theories and his presidency of M.I.T. I would suggest therefore, that you reorganize the lead so that readers will see immediately why Walker is an important figure. What are the two or three things readers need to know about him? Or to put it more colloquially, what is his main claim to fame? I would also suggest that you condense his war service so that the lead section is reduced in length from 479 words to between 350 and 400. (Note: I made a few minor edits to the lead section to correct minor glitches in spelling and grammar.)\n\n'''Background section'''\n\nI feel this section is interesting. It also gives useful background information. I have a few specific suggestions:\n* In the first paragraph, why is the reference to Holmes significant? Unless I missed it, there is no further reference to this friendship in the article. I would suggest either eliminating the mention of the Holmes family or adding something to indicate why it's significant.\n* First paragraph: \"As a boy, Walker...\" You need to mention his name here.\n* First paragraph: You might consider adding a bit more information about Walker's temper and personality. Why was his temper \"noted\" for example? There is very little in the entry to show the force of Walker's personality and it may be possible here to convey something more about Walker, the man.\n* Second paragraph: \"Beginning his schooling at the age of seven...\" \"Although he had planned to matriculate...\" and \"While he had entered with the class of '59...\" Too many sentences here in which you \"back into\" the subject. (The last two sentences appear consecutively.) They make the writing seem a bit labored.\n\n'''15th Massachusetts Volunteers section'''\n\nI'm not sure but there may be a bit too much detail here about Walker's various military rankings: \"However, the lieutenancy never materialized and Devens instead offered Walker an appointment as a sergeant major, which he assumed on August 1, 1861, after re-tailoring his previously ordered lieutenant's uniform to reflect his enlisted status. However, by September 14, 1861, Walker had been recommended by Devens and reassigned to Brig. Gen. Darius N. Couch as assistant adjutant general and promoted to captain.\" It's easy to get bogged down in this passage with its two consecutive sentences that begin with \"however\". You might consider condensing this passage. It depends on how important you feel these details are to a reader's overall understanding of Walker's military service.\n\n'''Second Army Corps section'''\n\nAn extremely interesting section! I'd suggest a few relatively minor changes.\n* I found the second sentence confusing. It begins, \"Although the II Corps later saw action...\" It's not clear to me whether Walker actually fought at Antietam and Fredericksburg. (I assume he did, but I think it needs to be stated more explicitly.) And why mention the Mud March, if Walker and II Corps had nothing to do with it?\n* The last paragraph mentions that Walker resigned his commission \"as a result of his injuries and health.\" I think more detail is needed here. His injuries are well described, but there's no information on the state of his health. I'm wondering too if any of the source material you consulted describes the effect his war experiences had on him.\n* I wonder if the information in the final paragraph of the \"Other interests\" section could be included here with some slight rewording. Something along these lines: \"Based upon his experiences in the military, Walker later published two books describing the history of the Second Army Corps (1886) as well as a biography of General Winfield Scott Hancock (1884). Walker also continued his affiliation with the military. In 1883, he was elected Commander of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and he served as President of the National Military Historical Association.\"\n\n'''Postbellum activity'''\n\nJust one minor comment. I'm not sure what you mean by \"representation\" in the last sentence. A bit more detail is needed here.\n\n'''1870 Census'''\n\nAnother highly interesting section. I have a few relatively minor editorial suggestions.\n* First paragraph: The writing is excellent up to the sentence which begins, \"Among the problems facing Walker included...\" This wording is not grammatically correct. Better to write something like: \"The problems facing Walker included...\"\n* First paragraph: I can't fully understand the sentence I refer to above. For example, I think there needs to be a fuller explanation of the marshalls' involvement as well as the influence of local political interests. I'd say a bit more information is needed to fully explain why Walker had no control over key aspects of the Census.\n* First paragraph: The last sentence needs more explanation. You appear to be referring to additional problems that Walker faced. You need to be explicit about this and you need to add something --- such as the word ''only'' --- to indicate more clearly why conducting a Census five years after the war is a problem for Walker.\n* Second paragraph: I notice that you start capitalizing ''Census'' while using lower case in the first paragraph. You need to be consistent. I think you should probably capitalize it, but I'm not absolutely sure. You might consult your source materials to see how this issue is handled.\n* Second paragraph: Not sure what you mean by ''confluence''.\n* Second paragraph: If it's possible, you might include a brief description of Walker's health problems. He seems to have been troubled by ill health all his life, yet he accomplished a great deal.\n* Second paragraph: The length of the second sentence makes it difficult to absorb all the information in it in a single reading.\n* Second paragraph: I also found the third sentence a bit too long and I had forgotten who Bowles was. There needs to be a better explanation of what you mean by \"go around.\"\n* Second paragraph: What do you mean by \"visual statistics\"? Charts and graphs or something else?\n* Second paragraph: I'm wondering why it's the ''Smithsonian Institute'' and not ''Institution''.\n* I'm wondering if material from the \"Other interests\" section could be moved to the bottom of this section. I'm referring specifically to the paragraph which begins: \"Walker also took an interest in demographics later in his career...\" I'll comment on that paragraph when I get to the \"Other interests\" section, but I do think that logically, it belongs in this section.\n\n'''Indian Bureau'''\n\n* The second sentence is too long and needs to be split into two or three shorter ones for the sake of readability. Maybe something along these lines: \"In the post-war era, the government redoubled its efforts to issue western land grants to settlers, ranchers, miners, and railroads. The new land grants heightened tensions with Native American tribes that had already been displaced from their homelands as well as stripped of their ostensible sovereignty following an 1872 act of Congress.\"\n* Not sure if it's ''chieftains'' or ''chiefs''.\n* \"Walker echoed Grant's recommendation that the Native Americans be secured on reservations of limited mineral or agricultural value so they could be educated and reformed.\" I think the idea that the reservations had limited economic value needs to be separated from the part about education and reform. Maybe something such as: \"Walker echoed Grant's recommendation that the Native Americans be secured on reservations in areas with little mining or farming potential. Once on these reservations, the Indians could be educated and reformed.\"\n* I have a couple of questions however, about the ideas in the sentences quoted immediately above. Was it just that the reservations had little in the way of minerals or agricultural value, or do you mean that the reservations were on land with few resources? What about timber for example? Depending on the facts, you may need to broaden these sentences. Maybe something like: \"Walker echoed Grant's recommendation that the Native Americans be confined to reservations on land not suitable for farming and with few resources such as minerals or timber.\" I'm also wondering if you can be more explicit about what you mean by \"reformed.\"\n* The word ''disinterest'' is contentious. It indicates impartiality, and some editors object to using it to mean ''lack of interest''.  In this case, \"lack of interest\", seems a bit understated. How specifically did the Modoc War motivate Walker to resign? For example, did the war convince him that the work of the Indian Bureau was futile?\n* Walker served as Superintendent of the Indian Bureau but he resigned his position as Commissioner. This needs clarification.\n* Last sentence: It's not clear to me whether you mean that Walker criticized his successors' graft, corruption, and abuse of power in his book ''The Indian Question''.\n\n'''Other engagements'''\n\nThe theme of this section seems to be Walker's rising prominence. Therefore, I think your headline here should reflect this in some way. \"Other engagements\" seems too vague and general. Some of this section is not about Walker's actual engagements. I'm thinking for example, of the ''Boston Post'' editorship which I assume Walker did not take. (It's not completely clear to me that he turned the job down.)\n* Second sentence: I'm not sure that you need to name Horace White and Charles Nordhoff. I think their names just add needless clutter. Since this section seems to follow chronological order, it might be useful to say when in 1876 that Walker was being recruited for the newspaper job.\n* Third sentence: I'm not sure you need the reference to the Mugwump movement. I think it would be more useful for readers if you gave a bit more detail about Walker's actual platform. (I read Wikipedia's Mugwump entry, but it didn't shed much light on Walker's political positions in the campaign you refer to here.)\n*Fourth sentence: I'd suggest slight changes for greater clarity. \"In the summer, the faculty of Amherst '''[College?]''' attempted to recruit him to become '''its''' '''p'''resident, but the position went instead to the Rev. Julius Hawley Seelye to appease conservative trustees.\"\n*Second paragraph, first sentence: Again I don't think you need to name Charles Francis Adams. Eliminating his name would also avoid the two \"bys\" that make this sentence awkward.\n* Note: I made a few edits to the rest of the second paragraph to improve flow and readability.\n\n== [[User:Bwark|Bwark]] ([[User talk:Bwark|talk]]) Part two ==\nI've split my comments and suggestions into two parts for easier editing. I'll continue discussing each of the sections in the order in which they appear in the entry.\n\n'''1880 Census'''\n\n* I would suggest re-arranging some of the sentences in this section. \n** The first sentence establishes the fact that Walker undertook the Census because of reforms spearheaded by Garfield. I feel it would be more logical to follow this sentence with the one in which you give an overview of Walker's achievement: \"The tenth Census '''which''' resulted in the publication of twenty-two volumes, was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time, and definitively established Walker's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation.\" \n** This sentence could be followed with the one discussing some potential problems: \"The Census was again delayed as a result of its size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its comprehensiveness and relevance.\" (I'm not quite sure however, what you mean by \"comprehensiveness and relevance.\" It might be necessary to explain a bit more. Do you mean for example, that this Census was praised for its comprehensiveness, but criticized because its delayed results were no longer relevant by the time they were published? Readers need to know exactly what you mean here.\n** At this point, I would suggest inserting the sentences which discuss how the 1880 Census cast a new light on Walker's earlier work. You would need to insert some kind of transition. Perhaps something along these lines: '''The improved methods used in the 1880 Census exposed discrepancies in Walker's earlier work.''' Its results suggested for example, that population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over the 1870 census. However, an investigation revealed that the earlier Census had been inaccurately enumerated. Walker publicized the discrepancy even as it effectively discredited the accuracy '''of''' his 1870 work.\" (Note: My suggested wording is far from perfect and still needs refinement. I'm assuming that the improved methods in 1880 exposed other discrepancies and that population increase in the Southern states was only one example. But that may not be accurate.)\n**I feel that the last two sentences in this section belong where they are, but I would tweak them a bit. Something like this: \"Walker also used his position '''as superintendent of the Census''' to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau. He argued such a Bureau would ensure not only that professional statisticians could be trained and retained, but that the information they gathered could be better popularized and disseminated. Following Garfield's 1880 election '''to the U.S. presidency''', there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to be Secretary of the Interior, but Walker had accepted the offer to become President of MIT in the spring of 1881 instead.\"\n\n'''Academic career'''\n\n* First sentence: by \"editorialist\" do you mean editorial writer, managing editor? You need to specify what you mean.\n* Second sentence: \"...he was unanimously offered to fill...\" This is awkward wording that also raises unanswered questions. It's not completely clear for example, what you mean by \"unanimously.\" You would need to say which body offered him this position. And I wonder if you need the two names in this sentence. The point is that Walker was offered a position at Yale and he accepted it.\n* Third sentence: \"While at Yale...\" You might signpost things for the reader by specifying how long Walker remained at Yale. For example: \"During his x years at Yale...\"\n* Second paragraph: I would suggest re-organizing this paragraph to group all the teaching appointments together.

In the \"Postbellum Activity\" section of this article, within the subsection, \"Indian Bureau\", the article makes Walker seem like a native-friendly policy maker. However, Hyde writes (in 2022, page 281) \"The commissioner of Indian affairs who managed this moment [when natives were not considered US citizens] was Francis Amasa Walker, an Amherst- and Harvard- trained statistician. He laid out his plans with chilling racial logic. Indians had to be incarcerated because 'the supreme law of public safety' demanded it.  He believed so deeply in Indians as a 'beggarly, savage race ... incapable of amibition' that he argued it was unjust and un-Christian for White men to make treaties with them. Crafted in a time of unending war, White reformers named these plans of military concentration and policed reservations a Peace Policy.\" This quote makes Walker seem like a policy maker for a concentration camp style reservation system. Does anyone think this should be included somehow in the article? [[User:Smellyshirt5|Smellyshirt5]] ([[User talk:Smellyshirt5|talk]]) 16:48, 25 October 2022 (UTC)\n\n:@[[User:Smellyshirt5|Smellyshirt5]], thanks for flagging this. The [[MIT Museum]] has a bust of Walker that looks like [[:File:Francis Amasa Walker deplatformed at the MIT Museum.jpg|this]], a deplatforming so archetypal I added it to the lead of [[deplatforming]]. So it's rather shocking to see that this article currently has no mention of any sort of stain on Walker's legacy in the lead or legacy section, and it leads me to believe that there are either major updates needed since the 2009 GAN or that the review missed major neutrality issues. I'm going to tag the article for neutrality, add a sentence on the photo, and put out a call-out to [[Talk:MIT]], which I'm guessing someone interested in the topic area is watching. <span style=\"color:#AAA\"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style=\"border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088\">[[User:Sdkb|<span style=\"color:#FFF\">'''Sdkb'''</span>]]</span><small>}&#125;</small></span>\u202f<sup>[[User talk:Sdkb|'''talk''']]</sup> 08:00, 8 January 2023 (UTC)\n::The above reference by Hyde is revisionist and inconsistent with Walker's words and actions.  Regarding reservations, consider this quote by Walker: \"Nor are the interests of the Indians any better served by the existing order (reservation system). Many tribes, even were they disposed to agriculture, would not find suitable land within the limits assigned to them. Others are in a position to be incessantly disturbed and harassed by the whites. Others still, while they stand across the path of settlement, are themselves, by ill-considered treaty provisions, cut off from access to hunting-grounds, to fishing privileges, or to mountains abounding in natural roots and berries, which would be of the greatest value to them.\" P 66 of The Indian Question.  \n::Regarding his view of the natives, consider this quote: \"To assertions that the Indian cannot he civilized, can be opposed instances of Indian communities which have attained a very considerable degree of advancement in all the arts of life. To the more cautious assertion, that, while the tribes which subsist chiefly on a vegetable diet are susceptible of being tamed and improved, the meat-eating Indians, the buffalo and antelope hunters, are hopelessly intractable and savage, can be opposed instances of such tribes which, in an astonishingly short time, have been influenced to abandon the chase, to undertake agricultural pursuits, to labor with zeal and patience, to wear white man's clothes, send their children to school, attend church on Sunday, and choose their officers by ballot. To the assertion that the Indian, however seemingly reclaimed, and for a time regenerated, still retains his savage propensities and animal appetites, and will sooner or later relapse into barbarism, can be opposed instances of slow and steady growth in self-respect and self-control, extending over two generations, without an indication of the tendencies alleged. To assertions that the Indian cannot resist either physical or moral corruption by contact with the whites, that he inevitably becomes subject to the baser elements of civilized communities, that every form of infectious or contagious disease becomes doubly fatal to him, and that he learns all the vices but none of the virtues of society, can be opposed instances of tribes which have freely mingled with the whites without debasement, and have acquired the arts of civilized life with no undue proportion of its evils. To the assertion that the Indian must gradually decline in numbers and decay in strength, his life fading out before the intenser life which he encounters, can be offered instances of the steady increase in population of no small number of tribes and bands in immediate contact with settlements, and subject to the full force of white influence.\"  P52 of The Indian Question.  Or this quote: \"Upon the authority of official reports, it will doubtless appear to every candid reader that the Cherokees are entitled to be ranked among civilized communities. Their condition is far better than that of the agricultural classes of England; and they are not inferior in intelligence or in the ability to assert their rights.\" P57\n::  \n::The definitive masterwork on the relations between natives and the government is \"The Great Father\" by Prucha which says that Walker: \u201chad strong humanitarian instincts and deep concern for fair treatment of the Indians.\u201d P 584\n::This article should not have a neutrality tag over this issue.

This article does a fantastic job  describing the mechanics and interconnection that define the MIL.

That is why it should not be the lead image, and why it is best suited in a section centering on the criticism of the MIL or its cost. \n:::The sources I cited above also demonstrate the range of normative opinion among reliable sources, from the MIL being a negative invention to it being underdeveloped in the age of tech. \n:::The examples of other criticism sections you cited are poor analogies.

He has given three variations of this language: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251007164900-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break Proposal 1], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008170200-Uhoj-20251007164900 2], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008205800-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break 3].  Uhoj also proposed adding a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008191400-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break quote] and incorporated it into version 3.\n#I would like to propose we change the first sentence back to its original wording [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex&diff=prev&oldid=1315612645 edit].  On talk, I initially thought this was a great way to frame the opening sentence but I was looking at the language in isolation and now realize it is repetitive and contradictory of paragraph 3 which states: {{tq|While the term military-industrial complex is often ascribed to Eisenhower, he was neither the first to use the phrase, nor the first to warn of such a potential danger}}.\n[[User:PositivelyUncertain|PositivelyUncertain]] ([[User talk:PositivelyUncertain|talk]]) 20:46, 9 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n:For discussion 1,  I want to state I surprised that a re-write of the paragraph had been proposed, as I thought the previous work we had done strengthened it quite a bit.  That said, I have considered the proposed language.  Here are my thoughts:\n:#The first sentence is misinterpreting what the source says.  \"War based complex\" was not used in earlier versions of the speech, it was used in discussions prior to the administration planning/drafting the speech. \n:#The second sentence removes sources and specificity about who made which claims\n:#The third sentence, which is new content, does not fit into the flow.  This information would fit better into the paragraph below.  However, because the source for this claim is a chapter written by Yarmolinsky himself, this is a primary source and our own interpretation of that primary source.  \n:#The fourth sentence is jargony, not easily understood, and doesn't fit into the content here.  I believe Uhoj's point is about the evolution after Eisenhower - 'prison industrial complex' etc.  This article should discuss how it has spawned other terms.  However it does not fit into this paragraph, which is about how the term came to be.\n:#I have already addressed my concerns with the fifth sentence: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-PositivelyUncertain-20251008171500-Uhoj-20251008170200]\n:#The final sentence, aka the quote, is interesting information and should be incorporated.  However, it should be fit into the final paragraph. \n:I also want to provide this last bit of feedback: the proposed paragraph was written in an academic style not suited for the general audience which contradicts [[WP:GENAUD]] and [[WP:NOTTEXTBOOK]].  In the future, I would recommend using simplified language for words like 'nascent' (a word I'd never even heard before and had to google), 'derivative', and 'snowclone'.

Nowhere does it say that 'war based' was quickly discarded. It states: \n:::::{{bq| On that morning, says the memo, Williams and Moos discussed two themes for the president\u2019s 1961 State of the Union Address.

The image demonstrates an important aspect of the military-industrial complex, making it suitable for inclusion. While it may not be the best possible image to serve its purpose, it is not Wikipedia policy to sit around and wait for such an image to fall into our hands before including any image. The idea that the image must be fully excluded because it shows a \"biased\" perspective is not supported by consensus, nor does it fit with the guidelines of [[MOS:IMAGEREL]] or the purpose of Wikipedia. However, '''there is no consensus on this being the lead image'''. Arguments include that the image does not best represent the whole subject, and presents a substantially and explicitly subjective view, without appropriate context, or that it perfectly captures the intent of the term and its primary use. ''(SUGGESTION: Applying [[MOS:LEADIMAGE]], it may be that there is no best lead image for the article, and it should therefore go without.

The argument that it is \"biased\" isn't policy-based; if the term's usage is largely pejorative (and that's, broadly, what the article says) then a natural and appropriate image of its use ''should'' reflect that usage - it would not be {{tq|natural and appropriate}} for us to dig up some obscure non-critical usage when most natural usage is critical.

My first concern would be [[WP:DUE]] because it would end up being 40% of the article's word count, if incorporated as-is. My next concern is that it reads like [[Wikipedia:NOTESSAY|an essay]], particularly in tone.

To be clear, I am ''not'' accusing you of [[WP:CHERRYPICKING]], and even if I were, I would assume it was unintentional and in [[Wikipedia:GOODFAITH|good faith]]. I don't have enough knowledge of this topic to know for sure, but that's the impression I get from its tone.

Here are two discussion points: \n#As it currently stands, Uhoj has drafted language to replace the paragraph after the quote.  He has given three variations of this language: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251007164900-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break Proposal 1], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008170200-Uhoj-20251007164900 2], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008205800-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break 3].  Uhoj also proposed adding a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008191400-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break quote] and incorporated it into version 3.\n#I would like to propose we change the first sentence back to its original wording [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex&diff=prev&oldid=1315612645 edit].  On talk, I initially thought this was a great way to frame the opening sentence but I was looking at the language in isolation and now realize it is repetitive and contradictory of paragraph 3 which states: {{tq|While the term military-industrial complex is often ascribed to Eisenhower, he was neither the first to use the phrase, nor the first to warn of such a potential danger}}.\n[[User:PositivelyUncertain|PositivelyUncertain]] ([[User talk:PositivelyUncertain|talk]]) 20:46, 9 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n:For discussion 1,  I want to state I surprised that a re-write of the paragraph had been proposed, as I thought the previous work we had done strengthened it quite a bit.  That said, I have considered the proposed language.  Here are my thoughts:\n:#The first sentence is misinterpreting what the source says.  \"War based complex\" was not used in earlier versions of the speech, it was used in discussions prior to the administration planning/drafting the speech. \n:#The second sentence removes sources and specificity about who made which claims\n:#The third sentence, which is new content, does not fit into the flow.  This information would fit better into the paragraph below.  However, because the source for this claim is a chapter written by Yarmolinsky himself, this is a primary source and our own interpretation of that primary source.  \n:#The fourth sentence is jargony, not easily understood, and doesn't fit into the content here.  I believe Uhoj's point is about the evolution after Eisenhower - 'prison industrial complex' etc.  This article should discuss how it has spawned other terms.  However it does not fit into this paragraph, which is about how the term came to be.\n:#I have already addressed my concerns with the fifth sentence: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-PositivelyUncertain-20251008171500-Uhoj-20251008170200]\n:#The final sentence, aka the quote, is interesting information and should be incorporated.  However, it should be fit into the final paragraph. \n:I also want to provide this last bit of feedback: the proposed paragraph was written in an academic style not suited for the general audience which contradicts [[WP:GENAUD]] and [[WP:NOTTEXTBOOK]].  In the future, I would recommend using simplified language for words like 'nascent' (a word I'd never even heard before and had to google), 'derivative', and 'snowclone'.

What the text does say is that the phrase 'war based' appeared in an October memo Williams wrote for a different speech; Williams claims he began using it months before that memo.  Nowhere does it say that 'war based' was quickly discarded. It states: \n:::::{{bq| On that morning, says the memo, Williams and Moos discussed two themes for the president\u2019s 1961 State of the Union Address.

The section is describing how the term has evolved after the speech (e.g., prison industrial complex) but you are using it to discuss the Eisenhower administrations use of the term.  Nowhere does it talk about a 'cliched phrase' or a snowclone.

Whether this is WP:CIR or WP:TEND/WP:CPUSH, I do not know. But regardless, the takeaway here is that any proposed language/rewriting needs to be checked by other editors to ensure it properly reflects the source and it's up to other editors to decide whether or not they are willing to go through such lengths.

[[User:Uhoj|Uhoj]] ([[User talk:Uhoj|talk]]) 21:07, 9 September 2025 (UTC)\n* '''No''' \u2014 An activist photo in the lead gives disproportionate weight to a single viewpoint (grassroots opposition), which is undue and not neutral. As the article primarily covers what the military\u2013industrial complex is, its history, and where it is applied, the lead and its image should reflect that summary. A protest image illustrates a critique of the topic rather than the topic itself and would be more appropriate in a section on criticism or activism. [[User:Spintheer|spintheer]] ([[User talk:Spintheer|talk]]) 00:47, 10 September 2025 (UTC)\n*:Edit: The above doesn't quite answer the RFC's question, so I am adding this clarification. I still believe that the image does '''not''' belong in the article (in its current form) because the article doesn't have sufficient dedicated verifiable coverage on criticism and grassroots criticism to warrant adding this image (DUE). Even once the article does have such coverage, this specific image may not be the one that is eventually used, because we may find a better one down the line. We'd have to see this hypothetical e.g. \"criticism/analysis\" section first and then decide. [[User:Spintheer|spintheer]] ([[User talk:Spintheer|talk]]) 20:08, 19 September 2025 (UTC)\n* '''No''' - As I already wrote in the section above about this, the same topic about the same photo. As stated in [[MOS:LEADIMAGE]], lead images are not required, and not having a lead image may be the best solution if there is no easy representation of the topic. Some of Eisenhower photos could be more connected and important to the main topic of this article and the expression, as the lead section image. But even that does not make an easy representation of the topic, so I think the best is as stated in MOS:LEADIMAGE.

I'm fine with with omitting \"merchants of death\".\n::::::::::::My understanding of Ledbetter p111 is the \"claim passed on only by oral history\" is Williams claiming credit for changing \"war based\" to \"military\". That it was originally \"war based\" seems to be proved by a document dated October 31, 1960. The current version makes it sound like it's doubtful that \"war based\" was used first.\n::::::::::::Also, is there a reason you're avoiding the rp template when citing page numbers?

What you call useless fluff is information that contextualizes the content and works it into the flow of the text.  \n:::::::::::::Think about this \"XXX was used in a memo in Obctober\" vs \"The phrase was thought to have been XXX before YYY\".  The first is like a random fact and if it was on it's own like that, I would question whether it needed to be in the article at all.  The second one lets us know that phrasing evolved which also flows better with the next sentence.\n:::::::::::::Even in convos from two months ago, I gave you feed back that it seemed like your version of the article included irrelevant information.  After further convos, like the one where after much back in forth you finally illuminated me as to why it was important that the term only rose to use years later, I suspect that in your mind you have a valid rational basis for why the content fits...but you don't add enough context for the reader to understand why the content fits.

I will reiterate that while we are having these discussions, using tags to flag uncited/unverified info is the best way to go as it gives others a chance to try and find sources.

Alternatively, I could be fine with Uhoj's language if we added a beginning sentence to the paragraph saying something like \"There has been much discussion about how the term evolved within the Eisenhower administration\" to help with flow, but Uhoj believes that is SYNTH.

I don't know off the top of my head what the [[WP:PAG|guidelines]] say about it.  I do believe from previous discussions about tagging that if a source is poor, rather than ask for a better source, the editor should look first and substitute a better source rather than tagging it.

That said, I have considered the proposed language.  Here are my thoughts:\n:#The first sentence is misinterpreting what the source says.  \"War based complex\" was not used in earlier versions of the speech, it was used in discussions prior to the administration planning/drafting the speech. \n:#The second sentence removes sources and specificity about who made which claims\n:#The third sentence, which is new content, does not fit into the flow.  This information would fit better into the paragraph below.  However, because the source for this claim is a chapter written by Yarmolinsky himself, this is a primary source and our own interpretation of that primary source.  \n:#The fourth sentence is jargony, not easily understood, and doesn't fit into the content here.  I believe Uhoj's point is about the evolution after Eisenhower - 'prison industrial complex' etc.  This article should discuss how it has spawned other terms.  However it does not fit into this paragraph, which is about how the term came to be.\n:#I have already addressed my concerns with the fifth sentence: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-PositivelyUncertain-20251008171500-Uhoj-20251008170200]\n:#The final sentence, aka the quote, is interesting information and should be incorporated.  However, it should be fit into the final paragraph. \n:I also want to provide this last bit of feedback: the proposed paragraph was written in an academic style not suited for the general audience which contradicts [[WP:GENAUD]] and [[WP:NOTTEXTBOOK]].  In the future, I would recommend using simplified language for words like 'nascent' (a word I'd never even heard before and had to google), 'derivative', and 'snowclone'.

One in particular stands out to me, [https://pages.uoregon.edu/kimball/MIC.trx.tested.htm summarized here]: \"In general, the military-industrial complex is not best understood as a conspiracy, but as a subtle interplay of interests and perceptions.\" My gut tells me this represents the scholarly consensus. I still think the article should discuss rhetoric, we just have to be careful about attribution. ''Who'' uses it as a pejorative, and why is this notable? If the phrase is used in [[Wikipedia:Fringe theories|fringe]] contexts, we should give them only as much weight as they warrant.

What we have is many scholars who discuss MIC and only some who describe it as a pejorative. We would need this viewpoint - that the term is hands down pejorative as opposed to 'can be used as a pejorative' to be widespread in the scholarship. We can't just take a few sources and claim that it applies to all relevant MIC scholars, therefore, adding \"some scholars\" better aligns with WP:V.

This article does a fantastic job  describing the mechanics and interconnection that define the MIL.

He has given three variations of this language: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251007164900-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break Proposal 1], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008170200-Uhoj-20251007164900 2], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008205800-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break 3].  Uhoj also proposed adding a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008191400-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break quote] and incorporated it into version 3.\n#I would like to propose we change the first sentence back to its original wording [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex&diff=prev&oldid=1315612645 edit].  On talk, I initially thought this was a great way to frame the opening sentence but I was looking at the language in isolation and now realize it is repetitive and contradictory of paragraph 3 which states: {{tq|While the term military-industrial complex is often ascribed to Eisenhower, he was neither the first to use the phrase, nor the first to warn of such a potential danger}}.\n[[User:PositivelyUncertain|PositivelyUncertain]] ([[User talk:PositivelyUncertain|talk]]) 20:46, 9 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n:For discussion 1,  I want to state I surprised that a re-write of the paragraph had been proposed, as I thought the previous work we had done strengthened it quite a bit.  That said, I have considered the proposed language.  Here are my thoughts:\n:#The first sentence is misinterpreting what the source says.  \"War based complex\" was not used in earlier versions of the speech, it was used in discussions prior to the administration planning/drafting the speech. \n:#The second sentence removes sources and specificity about who made which claims\n:#The third sentence, which is new content, does not fit into the flow.  This information would fit better into the paragraph below.  However, because the source for this claim is a chapter written by Yarmolinsky himself, this is a primary source and our own interpretation of that primary source.  \n:#The fourth sentence is jargony, not easily understood, and doesn't fit into the content here.  I believe Uhoj's point is about the evolution after Eisenhower - 'prison industrial complex' etc.  This article should discuss how it has spawned other terms.  However it does not fit into this paragraph, which is about how the term came to be.\n:#I have already addressed my concerns with the fifth sentence: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-PositivelyUncertain-20251008171500-Uhoj-20251008170200]\n:#The final sentence, aka the quote, is interesting information and should be incorporated.  However, it should be fit into the final paragraph. \n:I also want to provide this last bit of feedback: the proposed paragraph was written in an academic style not suited for the general audience which contradicts [[WP:GENAUD]] and [[WP:NOTTEXTBOOK]].  In the future, I would recommend using simplified language for words like 'nascent' (a word I'd never even heard before and had to google), 'derivative', and 'snowclone'.

The image demonstrates an important aspect of the military-industrial complex, making it suitable for inclusion. While it may not be the best possible image to serve its purpose, it is not Wikipedia policy to sit around and wait for such an image to fall into our hands before including any image. The idea that the image must be fully excluded because it shows a \"biased\" perspective is not supported by consensus, nor does it fit with the guidelines of [[MOS:IMAGEREL]] or the purpose of Wikipedia. However, '''there is no consensus on this being the lead image'''. Arguments include that the image does not best represent the whole subject, and presents a substantially and explicitly subjective view, without appropriate context, or that it perfectly captures the intent of the term and its primary use. ''(SUGGESTION: Applying [[MOS:LEADIMAGE]], it may be that there is no best lead image for the article, and it should therefore go without.

The argument that it is \"biased\" isn't policy-based; if the term's usage is largely pejorative (and that's, broadly, what the article says) then a natural and appropriate image of its use ''should'' reflect that usage - it would not be {{tq|natural and appropriate}} for us to dig up some obscure non-critical usage when most natural usage is critical.

My first concern would be [[WP:DUE]] because it would end up being 40% of the article's word count, if incorporated as-is. My next concern is that it reads like [[Wikipedia:NOTESSAY|an essay]], particularly in tone.

To be clear, I am ''not'' accusing you of [[WP:CHERRYPICKING]], and even if I were, I would assume it was unintentional and in [[Wikipedia:GOODFAITH|good faith]]. I don't have enough knowledge of this topic to know for sure, but that's the impression I get from its tone.

Here are two discussion points: \n#As it currently stands, Uhoj has drafted language to replace the paragraph after the quote.  He has given three variations of this language: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251007164900-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break Proposal 1], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008170200-Uhoj-20251007164900 2], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008205800-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break 3].  Uhoj also proposed adding a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-Uhoj-20251008191400-Etymology_--_arbitrary_break quote] and incorporated it into version 3.\n#I would like to propose we change the first sentence back to its original wording [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex&diff=prev&oldid=1315612645 edit].  On talk, I initially thought this was a great way to frame the opening sentence but I was looking at the language in isolation and now realize it is repetitive and contradictory of paragraph 3 which states: {{tq|While the term military-industrial complex is often ascribed to Eisenhower, he was neither the first to use the phrase, nor the first to warn of such a potential danger}}.\n[[User:PositivelyUncertain|PositivelyUncertain]] ([[User talk:PositivelyUncertain|talk]]) 20:46, 9 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n:For discussion 1,  I want to state I surprised that a re-write of the paragraph had been proposed, as I thought the previous work we had done strengthened it quite a bit.  That said, I have considered the proposed language.  Here are my thoughts:\n:#The first sentence is misinterpreting what the source says.  \"War based complex\" was not used in earlier versions of the speech, it was used in discussions prior to the administration planning/drafting the speech. \n:#The second sentence removes sources and specificity about who made which claims\n:#The third sentence, which is new content, does not fit into the flow.  This information would fit better into the paragraph below.  However, because the source for this claim is a chapter written by Yarmolinsky himself, this is a primary source and our own interpretation of that primary source.  \n:#The fourth sentence is jargony, not easily understood, and doesn't fit into the content here.  I believe Uhoj's point is about the evolution after Eisenhower - 'prison industrial complex' etc.  This article should discuss how it has spawned other terms.  However it does not fit into this paragraph, which is about how the term came to be.\n:#I have already addressed my concerns with the fifth sentence: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex#c-PositivelyUncertain-20251008171500-Uhoj-20251008170200]\n:#The final sentence, aka the quote, is interesting information and should be incorporated.  However, it should be fit into the final paragraph. \n:I also want to provide this last bit of feedback: the proposed paragraph was written in an academic style not suited for the general audience which contradicts [[WP:GENAUD]] and [[WP:NOTTEXTBOOK]].  In the future, I would recommend using simplified language for words like 'nascent' (a word I'd never even heard before and had to google), 'derivative', and 'snowclone'.

What the text does say is that the phrase 'war based' appeared in an October memo Williams wrote for a different speech; Williams claims he began using it months before that memo.  Nowhere does it say that 'war based' was quickly discarded. It states: \n:::::{{bq| On that morning, says the memo, Williams and Moos discussed two themes for the president\u2019s 1961 State of the Union Address.

The section is describing how the term has evolved after the speech (e.g., prison industrial complex) but you are using it to discuss the Eisenhower administrations use of the term.  Nowhere does it talk about a 'cliched phrase' or a snowclone.

Whether this is WP:CIR or WP:TEND/WP:CPUSH, I do not know. But regardless, the takeaway here is that any proposed language/rewriting needs to be checked by other editors to ensure it properly reflects the source and it's up to other editors to decide whether or not they are willing to go through such lengths.

[[User:Man-Man122|Man-Man122]] ([[User talk:Man-Man122|talk]]) 00:28, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n\n:We had an RFC specifically about this matter just recently. I think we should honor that outcome. It reflects how the vast majority of sources describe the game. Frankly, I don't think we need to change the lead just to appease a pair of FAC reviewers. FA status doesn't matter to me nearly as much as accurately reflecting the sources. It's not a requirement, while consensus and verifiability are core policies. [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 00:30, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n::In light of this dispute, I have withdrawn the FAC, so that won't be a concern. To tell you my thoughts, I personally consider ''Tetris'' a game with multiple versions, and that is what most sources describe it as. On the other hand, the scope of this article encompasses games that could be part of a ''Tetris'' series but greatly alter the base ''Tetris'' gameplay, with major examples including Pajitnov's and Nintendo's ''Tetris'' sequels, ''[[Tetrisphere]]'', ''[[Puyo Puyo Tetris]]'', ''[[Tetris 99]]'', and ''[[Tetris Forever]]''. This, among other reasons, is why I voted to call ''Tetris'' a series during the RfC. \n::Regardless of my opinions, I care more about resolving this dispute and making this article the best it can be. Before anyone claims that the RfC resolved it, the [[Talk:List of best-selling video games|talk page discussions at the List of best-selling video games page]] and the FAC nomination and resulting edit war just now have demonstrated that the dispute is still ongoing. Not to mention, the closing comment did not establish a strong consensus in either direction. Despite consensus supposed to be driven by argument quality, the closer did not assess which arguments were stronger, instead saying that opinions were mixed but the majority appeared to lean toward describing ''Tetris'' as a game. That does not sound like consensus to me. [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 04:50, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n:::See, I wouldn't call ''Tetris 99'' or ''Tetris Forever'' sequels. ''99'' has a battle Royale mode, but the single-player mode is just plain ''Tetris''. ''Forever'' is a retrospective including multiple ports, but each is still a port of ''Tetris''. That's always been the crux of the issue, one that's fairly unique to ''Tetris''\u2014they're still all the same core game, even if each version may have some distinct features to convince people to buy a game of which they likely already have a version. But that's how the sources consistently talk about it, as versions of the same core game. It's unusual, for sure. [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 05:07, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n::@[[User:Oknazevad|Oknazevad]] The sources use the word Tetris in a variety of manners. In some usages it means a brand, in other usages it means a franchise, in other usages it means a single game, and other usages it means a set or series of games.\n::  \n::This encyclopedia could have a separate article for every usage, or it could have a single article for all usages.The current article chose  to encompass all the usages, which is fine. However, If the article is going to include multiple usages,  the multiple usages must be clearly explained in the lead.\n::In addition, the words  \"version\" and \"variant\" and \"game\" and \"Tetris\" are used in a confusing manner within the article. This has nothing to do with what the sources say... this is a simple matter  of clarity and helping readers understand the content of the article. The same word cannot be used in two contradictory manners within a single article.... or, more precisely, when it is used that way it must be qualified with some kind of adjective or qualifier to make it clear to the reader what the precise meaning is in the context. Adding that kind of clarity has nothing to do with reflecting the sources usage, it has to do with making sure the readers understand what the sources were saying, in each specific  context.\n::Again, this is all because the word Tetris is used by the sources in a variety of ways to mean a variety of things.  The article cannot pick a single usage (even if that is the most common usage) and pretend the other usages do not exist, especially when that confuses the readers. The article needs to be honest about that and use very clear wording to help the reader grasp the multiple usages. [[User:Noleander|Noleander]] ([[User talk:Noleander|talk]]) 05:18, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n:::You make a good point. I'll probably expand on this thought tomorrow (it's late in my time zone and I have work tomorrow), but perhaps \"version\" should be used when a particular release sticks to the core gameplay, while \"variant\" for those that do things like crossovers or go 3-D or such. Just a first thought. The biggest thing is that the most common way a particular release is described is as \"a version of ''Tetris''\". That phrasing clearly indicates to me that the writer is describing it as a version of one thing, not part of many things, which is why the series descriptor shouldn't be the first thing in the article. \n\n:::And the \"media franchise\" link is wholly unneeded. This isn't like the [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] franchise where there's a core set of fictional characters who appear in written works like comics, TV series, and films. The existence of a merchandise bearing logos and associated images doesn't make [[Coca-Cola]] a media franchise, and it doesn't make Tetris one either. (And no, a dramatized presentation of the history of the game and the people behind it doesn't, either, any more than any dramatic telling of a historical event does.) [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 05:26, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n\n*The word \"video game\" or \"game\" can refer to a specific gameplay structure, rather than a specific individual creative work/piece of software. Articles like [[Minesweeper (video game)]] and [[Sokoban]] frame the same thing as a genre or a series respectively. None of these solutions are ideal. \"Series\"/\"Franchise\" unnecessarily excludes non-official versions of Tetris which are identifiably the same game. \"Genre\" suggests more variety than Tetris tends to have; Tetris is a specific implementation of a larger falling-block genre. [[Poker]] is described as a \"family\" of games, which might work, but is definitely not a supported phrasing here. Sources call Tetris a game, and I think that's fine. These are all identifiable games that happened to have been implemented and released in a variety of ways. When you say \"Tetris\", you mean the general mechanics of Tetris, which together form a game. Many sources are already framing it like that without even mentioning that they're doing it, so I think so can we. We shouldn't assume a reader would get confused by this; the framing of a \"video game\" as a specific published creative work is not the assumed base state. ~[[User:Maplestrip|<span style=\"color:#005080\">Maplestrip/Mable</span>]] ([[User talk:Maplestrip|<span style=\"color:#700090\">chat</span>]]) 10:15, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n*:{{green|\"Series\"/\"Franchise\" unnecessarily excludes non-official versions of Tetris which are identifiably the same game.}} Well, those unofficial versions are barely even mentioned in the article in the first place beyond the Tetris Company's enforcement of its IP. [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 04:56, 11 November 2025 (UTC)\n\nPerhaps there's a potential compromise solution. Most sources refer to ''Tetris'' as a game, yes. However, like I mentioned above, the article encompasses games that, sure, are heavily influenced by ''Tetris'' gameplay, but implement such heavy alterations that they cannot simply be called a version of ''Tetris''. To account for both of these points perhaps the first sentence should be something like \"''Tetris'' is a puzzle game series...\" with a footnote explaining how publications often consider ''Tetris'' to be a game. Any thoughts? [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 05:26, 11 November 2025 (UTC)\n\n:I object to including series in the first descriptor. ''Tetris''is consistently treated as a singular game the same way tennis is a singular game. (Yes, I chose that comparison specifically because the ''Tetris''name was in part inspired by the name \"tennis\".) Leaving that most common way of describing it to a footnote is not keeping in line with the sources. Let go of the idea that some versions having variation somehow reduces that core element of the game. That's where you're getting hung up. [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 17:21, 11 November 2025 (UTC)\n::I honestly don't know what you mean. Just because certain games share similar \"core elements\" does not mean they are the same game. For example, every ''[[Puyo Puyo]]'' game involves matching four puyos of the same color as they fall down a fixed screen. Every ''[[Bejeweled (series)|Bejeweled]]'' game involves matching three gems of the same color within a tile-based grid. Both ''Puyo Puyo'' and ''Bejeweled'' are generally considered puzzle video game series, not individual video games, despite the variation between games within those series being no more than the variation between ''Tetris'' games.

I'm sure there's better sources out there talking about Bejeweled in the same way as people talk about Tetris, or Tennis. ~[[User:Maplestrip|<span style=\"color:#005080\">Maplestrip/Mable</span>]] ([[User talk:Maplestrip|<span style=\"color:#700090\">chat</span>]]) 08:31, 12 November 2025 (UTC)\n::::I seriously doubt it.

[[User:Man-Man122|Man-Man122]] ([[User talk:Man-Man122|talk]]) 00:28, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n\n:We had an RFC specifically about this matter just recently. I think we should honor that outcome. It reflects how the vast majority of sources describe the game. Frankly, I don't think we need to change the lead just to appease a pair of FAC reviewers. FA status doesn't matter to me nearly as much as accurately reflecting the sources. It's not a requirement, while consensus and verifiability are core policies. [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 00:30, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n::In light of this dispute, I have withdrawn the FAC, so that won't be a concern. To tell you my thoughts, I personally consider ''Tetris'' a game with multiple versions, and that is what most sources describe it as. On the other hand, the scope of this article encompasses games that could be part of a ''Tetris'' series but greatly alter the base ''Tetris'' gameplay, with major examples including Pajitnov's and Nintendo's ''Tetris'' sequels, ''[[Tetrisphere]]'', ''[[Puyo Puyo Tetris]]'', ''[[Tetris 99]]'', and ''[[Tetris Forever]]''. This, among other reasons, is why I voted to call ''Tetris'' a series during the RfC. \n::Regardless of my opinions, I care more about resolving this dispute and making this article the best it can be. Before anyone claims that the RfC resolved it, the [[Talk:List of best-selling video games|talk page discussions at the List of best-selling video games page]] and the FAC nomination and resulting edit war just now have demonstrated that the dispute is still ongoing. Not to mention, the closing comment did not establish a strong consensus in either direction. Despite consensus supposed to be driven by argument quality, the closer did not assess which arguments were stronger, instead saying that opinions were mixed but the majority appeared to lean toward describing ''Tetris'' as a game. That does not sound like consensus to me. [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 04:50, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n:::See, I wouldn't call ''Tetris 99'' or ''Tetris Forever'' sequels. ''99'' has a battle Royale mode, but the single-player mode is just plain ''Tetris''. ''Forever'' is a retrospective including multiple ports, but each is still a port of ''Tetris''. That's always been the crux of the issue, one that's fairly unique to ''Tetris''\u2014they're still all the same core game, even if each version may have some distinct features to convince people to buy a game of which they likely already have a version. But that's how the sources consistently talk about it, as versions of the same core game. It's unusual, for sure. [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 05:07, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n::@[[User:Oknazevad|Oknazevad]] The sources use the word Tetris in a variety of manners. In some usages it means a brand, in other usages it means a franchise, in other usages it means a single game, and other usages it means a set or series of games.\n::  \n::This encyclopedia could have a separate article for every usage, or it could have a single article for all usages.The current article chose  to encompass all the usages, which is fine. However, If the article is going to include multiple usages,  the multiple usages must be clearly explained in the lead.\n::In addition, the words  \"version\" and \"variant\" and \"game\" and \"Tetris\" are used in a confusing manner within the article. This has nothing to do with what the sources say... this is a simple matter  of clarity and helping readers understand the content of the article. The same word cannot be used in two contradictory manners within a single article.... or, more precisely, when it is used that way it must be qualified with some kind of adjective or qualifier to make it clear to the reader what the precise meaning is in the context. Adding that kind of clarity has nothing to do with reflecting the sources usage, it has to do with making sure the readers understand what the sources were saying, in each specific  context.\n::Again, this is all because the word Tetris is used by the sources in a variety of ways to mean a variety of things.  The article cannot pick a single usage (even if that is the most common usage) and pretend the other usages do not exist, especially when that confuses the readers. The article needs to be honest about that and use very clear wording to help the reader grasp the multiple usages. [[User:Noleander|Noleander]] ([[User talk:Noleander|talk]]) 05:18, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n:::You make a good point. I'll probably expand on this thought tomorrow (it's late in my time zone and I have work tomorrow), but perhaps \"version\" should be used when a particular release sticks to the core gameplay, while \"variant\" for those that do things like crossovers or go 3-D or such. Just a first thought. The biggest thing is that the most common way a particular release is described is as \"a version of ''Tetris''\". That phrasing clearly indicates to me that the writer is describing it as a version of one thing, not part of many things, which is why the series descriptor shouldn't be the first thing in the article. \n\n:::And the \"media franchise\" link is wholly unneeded. This isn't like the [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] franchise where there's a core set of fictional characters who appear in written works like comics, TV series, and films. The existence of a merchandise bearing logos and associated images doesn't make [[Coca-Cola]] a media franchise, and it doesn't make Tetris one either. (And no, a dramatized presentation of the history of the game and the people behind it doesn't, either, any more than any dramatic telling of a historical event does.) [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 05:26, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n\n*The word \"video game\" or \"game\" can refer to a specific gameplay structure, rather than a specific individual creative work/piece of software. Articles like [[Minesweeper (video game)]] and [[Sokoban]] frame the same thing as a genre or a series respectively. None of these solutions are ideal. \"Series\"/\"Franchise\" unnecessarily excludes non-official versions of Tetris which are identifiably the same game. \"Genre\" suggests more variety than Tetris tends to have; Tetris is a specific implementation of a larger falling-block genre. [[Poker]] is described as a \"family\" of games, which might work, but is definitely not a supported phrasing here. Sources call Tetris a game, and I think that's fine. These are all identifiable games that happened to have been implemented and released in a variety of ways. When you say \"Tetris\", you mean the general mechanics of Tetris, which together form a game. Many sources are already framing it like that without even mentioning that they're doing it, so I think so can we. We shouldn't assume a reader would get confused by this; the framing of a \"video game\" as a specific published creative work is not the assumed base state. ~[[User:Maplestrip|<span style=\"color:#005080\">Maplestrip/Mable</span>]] ([[User talk:Maplestrip|<span style=\"color:#700090\">chat</span>]]) 10:15, 10 November 2025 (UTC)\n*:{{green|\"Series\"/\"Franchise\" unnecessarily excludes non-official versions of Tetris which are identifiably the same game.}} Well, those unofficial versions are barely even mentioned in the article in the first place beyond the Tetris Company's enforcement of its IP. [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 04:56, 11 November 2025 (UTC)\n\nPerhaps there's a potential compromise solution. Most sources refer to ''Tetris'' as a game, yes. However, like I mentioned above, the article encompasses games that, sure, are heavily influenced by ''Tetris'' gameplay, but implement such heavy alterations that they cannot simply be called a version of ''Tetris''. To account for both of these points perhaps the first sentence should be something like \"''Tetris'' is a puzzle game series...\" with a footnote explaining how publications often consider ''Tetris'' to be a game. Any thoughts? [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 05:26, 11 November 2025 (UTC)\n\n:I object to including series in the first descriptor. ''Tetris''is consistently treated as a singular game the same way tennis is a singular game. (Yes, I chose that comparison specifically because the ''Tetris''name was in part inspired by the name \"tennis\".) Leaving that most common way of describing it to a footnote is not keeping in line with the sources. Let go of the idea that some versions having variation somehow reduces that core element of the game. That's where you're getting hung up. [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 17:21, 11 November 2025 (UTC)\n::I honestly don't know what you mean. Just because certain games share similar \"core elements\" does not mean they are the same game. For example, every ''[[Puyo Puyo]]'' game involves matching four puyos of the same color as they fall down a fixed screen. Every ''[[Bejeweled (series)|Bejeweled]]'' game involves matching three gems of the same color within a tile-based grid. Both ''Puyo Puyo'' and ''Bejeweled'' are generally considered puzzle video game series, not individual video games, despite the variation between games within those series being no more than the variation between ''Tetris'' games. [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 19:22, 11 November 2025 (UTC)\n:::I have a hard time doing a decent source review with how Google has changed in the past decade, but I wonder if Bejeweled should be treated as a singular game concept as well, like Tetris. This source talks about it in that same way, for example: [https://www.businessinsider.com/the-history-of-bejewled-2013-9]. I'm sure there's better sources out there talking about Bejeweled in the same way as people talk about Tetris, or Tennis. ~[[User:Maplestrip|<span style=\"color:#005080\">Maplestrip/Mable</span>]] ([[User talk:Maplestrip|<span style=\"color:#700090\">chat</span>]]) 08:31, 12 November 2025 (UTC)\n::::I seriously doubt it.

Meanwhile, I searched \"Bejeweled\" on [[WP:VG/SE]], a search engine for video game sources considered reliable, and found multiple sources that referred to ''Bejeweled'' as a series, usually in the context of one of the direct sequels, ''[[Bejeweled 3]]'', such as [https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/24/bejeweled-3-review], [https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/09/bejeweled-twist-review], [https://kotaku.com/review-bejeweled-3-improves-the-unimprovable-5708588], [https://www.eurogamer.net/bejeweled-3-coming-to-360-ps3-ds], and [https://www.gamesradar.com/bejeweled-3-review/].

[[User:Andrzejbanas|Andrzejbanas]] ([[User talk:Andrzejbanas|talk]]) 14:44, 3 September 2024 (UTC)\n== Re-organization ==\n\nThe article at the moment seems to be about a few different things.\n* Goes into detail about ''Tetris'' gameplay, but varies from version to version\n* Goes into detail about reception, but varies from game to game, when each version of ''Tetris'' has unique gameplay elements. (not to mention we have versions of the article for the arcade and NES game made by Tengen at [[Tetris (Atari Games)]], the two games developed by Nintendo at [[Tetris (NES video game)]], and [[Tetris (Game Boy video game)]]. \n\nIts a bit all over the place. I propose the article gets a bit of a re-do. I suggest something to the effect of [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon]] for ''Tetris'' as various versions allow for various different formats and additions and perhaps having this version focus on either ''Tetris'' as a whole with brief mentions of the unique articles for the ones mentioned above. Perhaps even an article on the ''Tetris'' version by Spectrum Holobyte might be warranted as that seems to be one that would be most simple to cover from what most English-language sources and using this article for a more base history on the the development and spread of ''Tetris'' as a game/franchise/series. Thoughts? [[User:Andrzejbanas|Andrzejbanas]] ([[User talk:Andrzejbanas|talk]]) 13:13, 18 November 2024 (UTC)\n\n:While I'm personally not opposed to an article on the Spectrum Holobyte version and an article on the gameplay of ''Tetris'', I'm not sure what exactly you're asking us to change here. As is, this article already serves as a general overview of the development and impact of this game. Though I will say that I myself do have ideas as to how to improve this article. Maybe they will help with what you're asking. My ideas include condensing the gameplay section, expanding the last subsection of the history section to include more contemporary developments, and rewriting the reviews sub-section to encompass the broad range of ''Tetris''{{'s}} reception overtime rather than just the Spectrum Holobyte version. [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 21:32, 18 November 2024 (UTC)\n::To be fair, i'm not sure what this article ''should be''. ''Tetris'' is a complicated game to describe singularly as the various versions all have slightly different mechanics from the earliest releases for the NES, at least two DOS versions, Famicom, Game Boy, various arcade ports from Tengen and Sega and others. Not to mention later releases for the smart phones and online, and various PC iterations. I feel like you are on the right track of condensing the gameplay section here and having the article naturally spread out into article of the various ports that have enough coverage for their own articles. ''Tetris'' is just odd because as its earlier releases (such as the earliest MS-DOS release and the original ''Electronika 60'' do not have a traditional \"release\" or \"reception\" as other games do, it is complicated to discuss like we do with more traditional major games.

While in the early ''Retro Gamer'' game, he says Tetris was everywhere and the 2006 ''Retro Gamer'' article suggests that tons of Elektronika 60's had it, later, an entire book dedicated to ''Tetris'', suggests otherwise that it was more likely the DOS version that spread, as the Elektronika 60 was a very oudated computer and it was very hard to just \"transfer\" ''Tetris'', even if you had the code somehow. He also only got Vadim on board later for an IBM PC compatible version which added several features from his own game, including colour, so that balances out with the BBC documentary that it was the colour version that spread, not the Elektronika version. Despite this, I do not have full access to that ''Tetris'' book (christmas is around the corner), but may investigate further to see if it has any details on when that was made as even if it's not a release date, it can help give the user and understanding of when at least some people were playing a version of ''Tetris''.

I have no idea what specifically The Tetris Company wants to do with an anniversary, or what the anniversary is celebrating (as ''Tetris'' has a very convoluted release history and with their connection with Pajitnov, it seems like they are linking the 1984 period to not really a release, but the earliest development of it. Strange, but hardly impossible. As for Gerasimov's write-up, he could have easily realized he was wrong about the date, or mistyped it, and changed it. That said, your theory about the 25th anniversary of the game could have somehow put pressure on him or something/anything to change it.

About the new timeline Henk said to Nintendo Life, and I'm paraphrasing, \"well that's what Alexey said\" which feels no better or worse than a date from the hand of Vadim.

As whatever date is settled on should be supported by a variety of sources, and at this point we've got ~20 years of mostly printed sources that said 1985 and ~15 years of mostly online sources that say 1984, my hunch is that 2009 will be a quite obvious split date. Another thing I've just remembered is that there are timestamps on the original versions that have been preserved. I can't remember if it's the IBM PC version or Electronika 60 version, sorry. There's also likely to be supporting material in the forthcoming Tetris game compilation. The earliest Tetris book I have is a Japanese one from 1989 (pre-Game Boy version) but it doesn't list the creation/release date of the original. Even in year one outside of Russia, Tetris epoch, the creation date was mysterious. There's also a Russian book from 1987 about the Computer Center that mentions Tetris in passing, but sadly no date.   \u2014[[User:Flicky1984|Flicky1984]] ([[User talk:Flicky1984|talk]]) 01:11, 6 November 2024 (UTC)\n:::::::::::Oof.

For Sokoban, this is almost certainly not a doable split. For Minesweeper, we currently have only the first two. For Tetris, we could in theory create all three, but it might still be an unwanted split. Until then, making the genre/mechanics of \"Tetris\" and the franchise as a whole one article seems reasonable. We don't really have a word for this kind of platonic ideal of a game, I think.

I went through the list of games listed at [[List of Tetris variants]] and there seem to be 3 main categories of games. Tetris, the pure simple game, occasionally with slightly different mechanics ([[Pok\u00e9mon Mini#List of games|Pok\u00e9mon Tetris]] has the additional mechanic of being able to flip a piece horizontally as well as rotating it.) Tetris with heavy variants or additional game modes such as the oft cited [[Puyo Puyo Tetris]]. Finally games that are Tetris only in name, like [[Hatris]] which has less connection to Tetris than Counterstrike has to Half-Life. To support this view, here are excerpts from 3 different articles about early games: \"...they noted that the gameplay was unchanged from the original version.\"-[[Tetris Classic]], \"\"It...has the same gameplay as the computer editions\"-[[Tetris (Atari Games)]], \"The Game Boy version of Tetris plays identically to versions on other platforms.\"-[[Tetris (Game Boy video game)]] These are, I would say, releases of Tetris on different consoles just like how in this article we regard the original Elektronika 60 and the IBM PC as the same game.

Defining ''Tetris'' as a game and shifting the focus to that would lead to swaths of information being excluded despite their relevance and importance, and it would create a paradox in which the individual games are considered entries of a video game rather than a series.

''[[Space Invaders]]'' is not a series just because there are [[List of Space Invaders video games|clones of it]]; ''[[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]'' is not a series just because there are multiple ''Minesweeper'' games; [[chess]] is not a series just because there are different [[List of chess variants|variants of it]]. Unofficial variants of a game do not make it a \"series\". And while games such as ''[[Hatris]]'' exist and differ from archetypal ''Tetris'' gameplay, they were never claimed to be part of any \"''Tetris'' series\". This would also completely disregard the many, ''many'' articles on Wikipedia that refer to it as a video game, including [[World Video Game Hall of Fame]] (''Tetris'' is an inductee, and one of the first games to be inducted), [[List of video games considered the best]] (''Tetris'' is the most cited game on the list), and [[Game canon]] (''Tetris'' is the highest-ranked game on the list).

It's more like describing a sport. Just as different competitions in basketball have their own rulebooks (FIBA, NBA, NCAA, etc) which have also evolved over time, but are still quite clearly playing basketball, different versions of Tetris have rule peculiarities, but it's still essentially the same game where the essentials of gameplay are recognizable and consistent.

Not to mention later releases for the smart phones and online, and various PC iterations. I feel like you are on the right track of condensing the gameplay section here and having the article naturally spread out into article of the various ports that have enough coverage for their own articles. ''Tetris'' is just odd because as its earlier releases (such as the earliest MS-DOS release and the original ''Electronika 60'' do not have a traditional \"release\" or \"reception\" as other games do, it is complicated to discuss like we do with more traditional major games.

While in the early ''Retro Gamer'' game, he says Tetris was everywhere and the 2006 ''Retro Gamer'' article suggests that tons of Elektronika 60's had it, later, an entire book dedicated to ''Tetris'', suggests otherwise that it was more likely the DOS version that spread, as the Elektronika 60 was a very oudated computer and it was very hard to just \"transfer\" ''Tetris'', even if you had the code somehow. He also only got Vadim on board later for an IBM PC compatible version which added several features from his own game, including colour, so that balances out with the BBC documentary that it was the colour version that spread, not the Elektronika version. Despite this, I do not have full access to that ''Tetris'' book (christmas is around the corner), but may investigate further to see if it has any details on when that was made as even if it's not a release date, it can help give the user and understanding of when at least some people were playing a version of ''Tetris''.

[[User:Explodingcreepsr|Explodingcreepsr]] ([[User talk:Explodingcreepsr|talk]]) 07:48, 5 November 2024 (UTC)\n::::::I think we'll need to take a look at the ''The Tetris Effect'' book to be sure as it goes into the most details about the development of the game than any previous source I mentioned. As for Gerasimov, he does say he developed his version shortly after, but it looks like the initial MS-DOS version went through several drafts, as he states \"{{gt|In fact, I still enjoy programming in the descendant of Turbo Pascal - Borland Delphi.

I have no idea what specifically The Tetris Company wants to do with an anniversary, or what the anniversary is celebrating (as ''Tetris'' has a very convoluted release history and with their connection with Pajitnov, it seems like they are linking the 1984 period to not really a release, but the earliest development of it. Strange, but hardly impossible. As for Gerasimov's write-up, he could have easily realized he was wrong about the date, or mistyped it, and changed it. That said, your theory about the 25th anniversary of the game could have somehow put pressure on him or something/anything to change it. That said, we have no proof of either and we can't just assume some conspiracy is happening regarding the dates without some sort of proof.

[[User:Andrzejbanas|Andrzejbanas]] ([[User talk:Andrzejbanas|talk]]) 23:03, 5 November 2024 (UTC)\n:::::::::It was my understanding that Vadim changed his website on request of Pajitnov/Tetris Co. The issue with the Tetris Effect book, for me, is that it was made after 2009 and so uses the revised timeline. Same with the article/interview in The Guardian, etc. I'm wary of this as I've previously mentioned, it feels too much like rewriting history. About the new timeline Henk said to Nintendo Life, and I'm paraphrasing, \"well that's what Alexey said\" which feels no better or worse than a date from the hand of Vadim. With each source it's almost as if we need to figure out are they referencing the E3 2009 revised timeline or the one that existed for ~20 years before that. I'm up with helping add to a spreadsheet of source data, if one is created/owned by somebody else. As whatever date is settled on should be supported by a variety of sources, and at this point we've got ~20 years of mostly printed sources that said 1985 and ~15 years of mostly online sources that say 1984, my hunch is that 2009 will be a quite obvious split date. Another thing I've just remembered is that there are timestamps on the original versions that have been preserved. I can't remember if it's the IBM PC version or Electronika 60 version, sorry. There's also likely to be supporting material in the forthcoming Tetris game compilation. The earliest Tetris book I have is a Japanese one from 1989 (pre-Game Boy version) but it doesn't list the creation/release date of the original. Even in year one outside of Russia, Tetris epoch, the creation date was mysterious. There's also a Russian book from 1987 about the Computer Center that mentions Tetris in passing, but sadly no date.   \u2014[[User:Flicky1984|Flicky1984]] ([[User talk:Flicky1984|talk]]) 01:11, 6 November 2024 (UTC)\n:::::::::::Oof. Yeah, as said the release date of this material is down to just what the creators memories. I doubt we'll have an earliest release date, but we can at least go by what the developers state and note when they have given different answers to tell readers that generally, there have been contradictions. I've done similar things for the article on \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]] where I couldn't confirm what a specific date was. I felt comfortable throwing away the ones that were just flat out off by other historical timelines that made sense with news articles of the day.

Yes, there's mechanical variations between versions/editions, and expert ''Tetris''players pay close attention to the differences as they impact high-level play, but they're still all ''Tetris'', which is why reliable sources (both VG-specific and general, as noted by Lazman above) write about it in such a way, treating them not as separate games, but as revisions of the same core game. We should follow their example because we follow the sources. [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 19:46, 10 April 2025 (UTC)\n:::The chess analogy is interesting. But chess is a historic tradition that belongs to no one, while Tetris is a modern product that is owned (for the most part) by The Tetris Company. Chess can be transmitted as a single game with many mutations because it's a public domain idea, while Tetris requires a license from the owner. (Not to mention that chess is a lofi game that anyone with a flat surface can homebrew, while every version of Tetris has a distinct developer because of the effort involved.)

For Sokoban, this is almost certainly not a doable split. For Minesweeper, we currently have only the first two. For Tetris, we could in theory create all three, but it might still be an unwanted split.

I went through the list of games listed at [[List of Tetris variants]] and there seem to be 3 main categories of games. Tetris, the pure simple game, occasionally with slightly different mechanics ([[Pok\u00e9mon Mini#List of games|Pok\u00e9mon Tetris]] has the additional mechanic of being able to flip a piece horizontally as well as rotating it.) Tetris with heavy variants or additional game modes such as the oft cited [[Puyo Puyo Tetris]]. Finally games that are Tetris only in name, like [[Hatris]] which has less connection to Tetris than Counterstrike has to Half-Life. To support this view, here are excerpts from 3 different articles about early games: \"...they noted that the gameplay was unchanged from the original version.\"-[[Tetris Classic]], \"\"It...has the same gameplay as the computer editions\"-[[Tetris (Atari Games)]], \"The Game Boy version of Tetris plays identically to versions on other platforms.\"-[[Tetris (Game Boy video game)]] These are, I would say, releases of Tetris on different consoles just like how in this article we regard the original Elektronika 60 and the IBM PC as the same game. Finally here is my proposed text:\n:::\"'''''Tetris''''' is a game created in 1985<sup>[a]</sup> by [[Alexey Pajitnov]], a Soviet software engineer. ... Pajitnov originally programmed the game on the [[Elektronika 60]] and then ported it to the IBM PC with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]]. ... [[Henk Rogers]] negotiated to get the rights to release ''Tetris'' on the [[Game Boy]] and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The Game Boy version became the best selling version of ''Tetris'' and one of the best-selling video games of all times.

Tetris has different versions, with gameplay changes in some generations or releases to keep players interested; chess has different versions, in [[Fast chess|speed of play]], or in odd rule sets ([[3D chess]], [[Chess960]], etc).

After weighing the evidence, I believe that calling ''Tetris'' a series, perhaps with a footnote explaining the complication, may be what's best for our encyclopedia. To start off, while most sources do refer to ''Tetris'' as a game, I have found some sources that do refer to the \"Tetris series\" such as [https://kotaku.com/the-evolution-of-the-tetris-song-from-1987-to-today-1533072841 Kotaku], [https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-might-be-teasing-puyo-puyo-tetris-for-pc Eurogamer], [https://venturebeat.com/games/pit-blocks-3d-revives-a-virtual-boy-gem-for-pc/ VentureBeat], and [https://www.gamesradar.com/tetris-effects-soundtrack-is-now-available-to-stream-for-free/ GamesRadar+], meaning it would not violate [[WP:NOR]]. Most notably, [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67105983 this BBC article] explicitly considers ''Tetris'' the second-best-selling video game series rather than the best-selling video game of all time and provides an explanation as to why: mechanics differ between games, often to a great extent.\n:There is a bit of a [[WP:NPOV]] dilemma in that calling ''Tetris'' a series rather than a game could be giving a minority view [[WP:UNDUE]] weight. However, this is an instance where [[WP:IAR]] might come into play. While referring to ''Tetris'' as a series might be inconsistent with most sources, I believe referring to ''Tetris'' as a game for this particular article would be worse for this encyclopedia, since the focus of this article encompasses many games that no one would reasonably just call a version of ''Tetris''. Defining ''Tetris'' as a game and shifting the focus to that would lead to swaths of information being excluded despite their relevance and importance, and it would create a paradox in which the individual games are considered entries of a video game rather than a series. While a compromise solution, such as including a footnote or creating an article on the gameplay itself, would be welcome given the circumstances; at the present moment, this is the decision I am leaning toward.

These early versions are covered in the article, but most of it is about the franchise that they spawned. I recommend altering the lead, short description and infobox to indicate the franchise as the subject, including switching to [[Template:Infobox video game series]]. ''Tetris'' has had many involved companies, people and platforms; I recommend looking at ''[[Final Fantasy]]''{{'s}} infobox as a sort-of similar example.\n\nIn 2022, some editors [[Talk:Tetris/Archive_2#Splitting_into_Tetris_(franchise)_and_Tetris_(1984_video_game)_articles|discussed splitting the original implementation from this article]], but it was not followed up on. Personally, I'm not sure that the original game, or Gerasimov's port, need their own articles; they are covered well in this one.\n\n==== Lead section ====\n* In the hatnote, \"video game in general\" should be changed to \"video game franchise\"\n:* Changed to video game series instead. [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 04:56, 31 March 2025 (UTC)\n::I oppose this change. ''Tetris'' is a single game in the way baseball is a single sport, not a series in the vein of ''Call of Duty'' or other such games.

However, there is a complication with the article's subject. While ''Tetris'' is indeed more accurately a series of puzzle video games rather than an individual game, many sources treat ''Tetris'' as an individual game with multiple versions, and this article often does accordingly, with the most obvious example being its Guinness World Record for being the most-ported game. Is there any way you would suggest addressing this? [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 20:27, 31 March 2025 (UTC)\n:While many of the early games might be more accurately called \"remakes\" than ports, in ''Tetris''{{'s}} case the media does tend to call them ports. I think it's okay for us to call them that too, in the right context. For example, it would be weird to think of ''Tetrisphere'' as a port.\n:As for Guinness, there are two records cited{{snd}}65+ \"ports\" in 2008, and 220 \"variants\" in 2017. Also, the language of [https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-ported-computer-game the \"ports\" award] has changed since it was first added to the article. It looks like it is actually counting the number of systems that ''Tetris'' games have been published for, and has been updated to 70. [[User:3df|3df]] ([[User talk:3df|talk]]) 23:46, 31 March 2025 (UTC)\n::Yeah, when it comes to video games the term \"port\" is standard language even when the implementation of a game isn't really strictly ported in the technical sense of reusing code with minimal rewriting. But that's an issue with all video game media and is the established usage, not something this article needs to try to correct. \n::To that end I'm also going to reiterate my objection to calling ''Tetris'' a series of games. That's not how sources talk about it. They treat it as a single game with multiple versions or implementations, just as chess is the same game regardless of whether one is playing with a five dollar plastic and cardboard set, an antique ebony and ivory set, or one of the myriad of computer implementations. We should too, as we need to follow the sources. [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 14:49, 3 April 2025 (UTC)\n:::{{ping|3df}} Any thoughts? Personally, I'm on the fence on this issue. On one hand, there are many spin-offs of ''Tetris'' discussed in this article that are clearly different games, but on the other hand, sources do often refer to ''Tetris'' as an individual game with multiple versions, as ''Tetris''{{'s}} gameplay is often the same between versions. As such, I personally see merit on both sides and wonder if there's a way to compromise between them. [[User:Lazman321|Lazman321]] ([[User talk:Lazman321|talk]]) 17:29, 3 April 2025 (UTC)\n::::I'm also on the fence, but leaning towards calling it a series (and using both verbiages as appropriate throughout the article). This is made even stranger because so many publishers released it under so many good-or-not licenses from various sources. Oknazevad is absolutely right about ''Tetris'' being in a class of games like chess or baseball, which are defined by agreed-upon books of rules ([[Rules of chess|chess]], [[Baseball rules|baseball]]) and have their various [[Sports governing body|sports governing bodies]].\n::::''Tetris'' is also an intellectual property and media franchise, with officially licensed music and now a feature film. I think that the article where it is now is doing fine to cover both ''Tetris'' as a defined game and as a franchise{{snd}}the decision of which name to use being this implementation detail on top.\n::::Even if very many of the games are largely considered ports, there are versions that are certainly very different while still being considered a part of the ''Tetris'' \"series\". Sources talk about ''PPT'' and ''Tetris Effect'' as though they are their own, new games. You'd definitely look at them and say, \"that's ''Tetris''\", and be correct in both senses. But neither of them are ''Tetris'' (1985). [[User:3df|3df]] ([[User talk:3df|talk]]) 19:38, 4 April 2025 (UTC)\n:::::I think you may have to close this review.

I recommend removing ''Tetris Effect'' from the list unless a more recent source exists.\n* While interesting, the number for ''Tetris 99'' is noted as only applying to special physical copies.

Currently, there are a few disadvantages listed under the \"comparison with other data structures\" section.\n\nAnd one disadvantage that I don't see mentioned anywhere is the space/time tradeoff of managing child nodes: either you need a (potentially large and sparse) array of indexes at each node, or you need to implement a secondary search algorithm to find the appropriate child(eg, the Python example uses a hash lookup over a dictionary of children). While the indexed approach may not be an issue for relatively shallow tries using ASCII (ie, the example at the top of the page), it will quickly become an issue with deep tries and/or large value spaces (eg, Unicode).

This will never finds strings that are prefixes of other strings that are also stored in the trie. Am I mistaken?\n*That's exactly what I thought. I think the other algorithm was actually wrong entirely, since it would only match true if there was a NULL node (no node at all) for the end of the word. I've made the correction of adding a \"terminal\" field which denotes the end of a word. &mdash;[[User:EatMyShortz|EatMyShortz]] 13:52, 30 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n\n\n\"Average lookup speed is theoretically the same, but a trie is faster in practice.\"\nThat seems like a highly dubious claim, unsupported by evidence! In my experience the opposite is usually true (the main benefit of tries is thus that it can grow easily, and it may take less space since prefixes of keys are shared).\n* The performance is highly related to the usage pattern.  In a hashtable, you can retrieve a value while touching only in 1-2 cache lines on average, whereas in a trie this can be upto its depth (length of the prefix).  However, a HT will almost always require these cache fetches whereas especially in a tight loop the trie will often have most or all of the lines cached (and esp for negative results). --[[User:66.7.145.210|66.7.145.210]] 18:27, 5 October 2006 (UTC)\n** Also as I know, a hashtable lookup requires the search-key to be hashed before while the lookup in a trie can start almost instantly. Does anybody else know the [http://judy.sourceforge.net Judy Arrays] or [http://code.google.com/p/google-sparsehash/ Google sparsehash]? I think these are an implementation of tries (at least its JudySL class) altough the term \"trie\" is never used to describe both of them. --[[User:195.3.81.25|195.3.81.25]] 10:15, 27 August 2007 (UTC)\n\nI'm not certain-enough of this to edit the document without research, but... If you are going to take the length of keys into account when discussing the complexity of lookup with tries then you should do the same with the other methods --otherwise you are comparing apples to oranges. Normally in discussing binary trees and hash tables, it is assumed that the keys are small constant-sized objects. When discussing tries, you have to think of strings. In this case, each comparison in a binary-tree search is a O(m) string compare so the complexity of the lookup is not O(log n) but O(log n*m). Similarly, the expected lookup time for a hash table is O(m), not O(1) because forming the hash typically takes O(m) time (you can avoid looking at all characters, but that probably effects the expected lookup time). --David Gudeman  <small>\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.181.140.228|69.181.140.228]] ([[User talk:69.181.140.228|talk]]) 04:22, 14 July 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n:You are correct about apples and oranges. However, your calculation of the complexity of a trie lookup is wrong. It is O(m), not O(m logn). In fact, to be more precise, it is O(m*p), where p is the number of letters in the alphabet. The number of words that are already in the trie (n) is completely irrelevant. More so than for hash tables, whose lookup complexity is not completely independent from n, due to the possibility of collisions. This cannot be captured nicely in a formula, so we simply say that hash table lookups are O(m).\n:In any case, I was very surprised to see that complexity information is completely missing from the article!

What do these numbers represent? I can't for the life of me work it out - could an explanation also be added to the article?\n\nI don't think they are intended to have any meaning. The use of numbers may not have been the most effective way to make their point, which is that only nodes with valid keys store values. Notice that the \"t\" and \"te\" nodes are not marked with numbers. This is because \"t\" and \"te\" are not real English words; therefore, they cannot serve as keys to any value (this _seems_ to be the idea). I don't think readers will be confused by this in general though, because the third paragraph provides an explanation. Maybe this was added after you made your request. [[User:Danielx|Danielx]] 08:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nI agree with Danielx about the meaning of the numbers (i.e. they are merely arbitrary \"values\" associated with the string \"keys\"). However I have a problem with the diagram caption. Since, as Danielx points out, \"t\" and \"te\" are not marked with numbers then they are not \"keys\", but just key prefixes. The caption lists them as if they were keys and I believe that may be confusing.

In other words, the children of a node would have to be traversed in lexicographic order.\n\nPlease see this link for a reference: http://books.google.com/books?id=G_U8ghxhT4wC&pg=PA379&dq=lexographic+sorting+using+trie\n\n[[User:Cgrunewald|Calvin]] ([[User talk:Cgrunewald|talk]]) 17:22, 18 February 2009 (UTC)\n\nSome people overgeneralize from seeing examples where strings are only associated with the leaf nodes in a trie to believing, incorrectly, that strings can only be associated with the leaf nodes in a trie.  When a trie represents overlapping strings, such as, \"the\", and, \"there\", the word, \"the\", will be associated with an interior node of the trie and will be encountered first and be printed first in a preorder traversal before the preorder traversal reaches the node that is associated with the word, \"there\", which itself might be associated with an interior node if there is a longer overlapping string represented by the trie, such as, \"therefore\".\n\nWhether or not a postorder traversal of a trie will produce text in reverse lexicographic order depends on how the strings are represented.

An Euler tour of a tree structure covers both pre-order and post-order traversal of a tree structure in the same pass.

I have no citation for this, just my original insight.  Otherwise, a depth-first traversal would be appropriate.\n\nIn a binary search tree, any descendant nodes down to the left branch of a given parent node contain values that are lower than the value in the parent node, and any descendant nodes down to the right branch of a given parent node contain values that are higher than the value in the parent node.  For the strings, \"The\", \"There\", and, \"Therefore\", the word, \"There\", might be in the root node, and the word, \"The\", might be in the left child node, and, the word, \"Therefore\", might be in the right child node.  Imagine there is a line connecting, \"There\", with, \"The\".  Imagine there is another line connecting, \"There\", with, \"Therefore\":\n\n::There\n:The  Therefore\n\nAn in-order traversal is usually implemented as a recursive depth-first traversal algorithm that attempts to go as far down the left branches of a binary tree as a possible.  Upon returning from a visit down a left branch, the contents of the current node are printed.  Then, the algorithm attempts to recursively go down the right branch.  Pseudocode for an in-order traversal is:\n\n:Procedure InOrder(p as Pointer)<br>\n:Begin\n::If p is Null Then Return\n::InOrder(p->Left)\n::Print p->String\n::InOrder(p->Right)\n:End\n\nSo, in this example, the InOrder() procedure would be called with a pointer to the root node, which contains the value, \"There.\"  The procedure recursively calls itself with a pointer to the left node.  The second instance of the procedure corresponds to the left child node that contains, \"The\".  This instance of the procedure then calls itself recursively with a Null pointer for the left node.  The third instance of the procedure then immediately returns, because the pointer is Null.  Upon returning from the left branch, the second instance of the procedure prints the contents of the current node, \"The\".  The second instance of the procedure then recursively calls itself with a Null pointer to the right branch.  The fourth instance of the procedure immediately returns to the second instance of the procedure, because the pointer is Null.  Upon returning from the right branch, the second instance of the procedure then returns to the first instance of the procedure which corresponds to the root node.  Upon returning from the left branch, the first instance of the procedure prints the contents of the root node, \"There.\"  The first instance of the procedure then recursively calls a fifth instance of the procedure with a pointer to the right node, which contains, \"Therefore\".  The fifth instance of the procedure then recursively calls itself with a Null pointer to the left node.  The sixth instance of the procedure immediately returns, since the pointer is Null.  Upon returning from the left branch, the fifth instance of the procedure then prints the value in the current node, \"Therefore\".  The fifth instance of the procedure then recursively calls itself with a Null pointer to the right node.  The seventh instance of the procedure then immediately returns, since the pointer is Null.  Upon returning from the right branch, the fifth instance of the procedure that corresponds to the word, \"Therefore\", then returns to the first instance of the procedure corresponding to the root node.  Upon returning from visiting the right branch, the first instance of the procedure corresponding to the root node then returns, finishing the in-order traversal.\n\nA preorder traversal prints or otherwise processes the value associated with the current node in a tree first before visiting any descendant nodes.  That is what has to be done to print in ascending lexicographic order the values represented by a trie where the strings:\n\n:The<br>\n:There<br>\n:Therefore<br>\n\nare arranged as overlapping paths in the trie where the paths represent the individual digits or individual characters of the string prefixes.  There are multiple options for how to represent the strings.  For example, you can concatenate the string prefixes that are represented by a path that has been traversed from the root node down to a given node or have a pointer to a string in each node that corresponds to the path that has been traversed from the root node down to a given node.  A trie doesn't have to be a binary trie, but if it were a binary trie, the pseudocode for a preorder traversal would be something like:\n\n:Procedure PreOrder(p as Pointer)<br>\n:Begin\n::If p is Null then Return\n::Print p->String\n::PreOrder(p->Pointer[0]) 'Recursively visit any nodes down the branch corresponding to string prefix digit zero.\n::PreOrder(p->Pointer[1]) 'Recursively visit any nodes down the branch corresponding to string prefix digit one.\n:End\n\nA postorder traversal routine goes as deep as possible down a particular branch of a tree until no further descent is possible and then switches to the next available branch, recursively going down until no further descent is possible for any branch, and prints or otherwise processes the contents of the current node prior to returning.  The text book version of postorder traversal that I learned depicted visiting the branches from the left to right, but for displaying the values associated with a trie in descending lexicographic order, the branches have to be visited from right to left, corresponding to the higher digital values to the lower digital values.  The pseudocode for a postorder traveral of a binary trie would be something like:\n\n:Procedure PostOrder(p as Pointer)<br>\n:Begin\n::if p is Null then Return\n::PostOrder(p->Pointer[1]) 'Recursively visit any nodes down the branch corresponding to string prefix digit one.\n::PostOrder(p->Pointer[0]) 'Recursively visit any nodes down the branch corresponding to string prefix digit zero.\n::Print p->String\n:End\n\nIn-order traversal, preorder traversal, and postorder traversal are all depth-first traversal algorithms.  I don't like using hyphens for spelling pre-order or post-order traversal, because it takes too long to type.  If you visualize in your mind the sequence of nodes that are visited by these recursive algorithms, then you will see that depth-first traversal is equivalent to the wall following algorithm for traversing a maze by keeping one of your hands on a wall at all times, which will make the maze traveler visit all of the maze if there is no exit.  You can see examples of real preorder and postorder traversal routines for a binary trie in the C language source code for my BRADSORT program, which is one of the first implementations of a trie-based radix sorting algorithm, which you can probably find with Google.

My reasoning is as follows:\n* This pseudocode is less descriptive. It does not present types and relies on syntactic quirks of other languages that ironically, make it less universal. For example, in the removal method, <code>key[1:]</code> is an inherently Python-esque syntax. It also introduces <code>:=</code> while using <code>=</code> for equality checking, etc. There are also places where it relies on implicit (rather than explicit) constructs, like <code>Node()</code> (which probably refers to calling a constructor, but isn't defined anywhere).\n* The claim that Java is more verbose or more noisy is inherently not true. This is not even opinion, but the pseudocode examples introduce noise keyword like \"then\", \"do\", \"repeat\", \"end\", etc. At that point why not just omit those keywords and rely on Python-style indentation, which is just as descriptive on where scope begins and ends? Furthermore, making the parameter <code>x</code> explicit is also additional noise when it could much more simply just be expressed as a method of the structure on itself.\n* Java (at the very least, in my opinion) has very simple syntax, and I don't see how the pseudocode provided is somehow more descriptive than the Java examples (in my opinion it is less descriptive but this is my opinion)\n* The claim that \"pseudocode has a wider appeal\" is inherently meaningless because pseudocode is not an actual language. If the pseudocode isn't any more descriptive or simple than a real code example, at that point, why not just write the instructions in English? It feels like pseudocode is being used here just for the sake of using pseudocode. Nothing is gained from using it (it's not \"easier to read\" nor is it \"syntactically simpler\", it is being chosen simply for not being an actual language, etc.)\n* Concrete code examples are not only better but can be demonstrated on the user's end if they choose to compile and produce the code themselves.\n* The pseudocode examples are more tedious and difficult to maintain. Keywords are manually bolded and line counts are manually written rather than automatically generated.\nI also wish to bring the attention that the code was previously written in Python (and there was a second implementation in Go, which was removed for being extraneous which I agree with) but was unilaterally changed to pseudocode by [[User:WikiLinuz]], without any talk. I replaced the pseudocode with Java examples but @[[User:Ergur|Ergur]] removed these changes.

To give an example of exactly what I mean, let us take a look at this simple algorithm that finds the largest value in a list, using the same pseudocode style as the article. As you have declared your proficiency in computer science, I am sure you are aware of exactly what is happening in the following code.\n:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"py\">\nfindLargestValue(list):\n    if not list or list.length == 0 then\n        raise IllegalArgumentException(\"Array is empty\")\n    end if\n    largest := list[0]\n    for i in list do\n        if list[i] > largest then\n            largest = list[i]\n        end if\n    repeat\n    return largest\n</syntaxhighlight>\n:: Meanwhile, in Java:\n:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\npublic static int findLargestValue(int[] list) {\n    if (list == null || list.length == 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Array is empty\");\n    }\n    int largest = list[0];\n    for (int i: list) {\n        if (list[i] > largest) {\n            largest = list[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return largest;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n:: The logic is expressed in exactly the same way. There are no Java-specific quirks in the Java snippet. Just because it contains the keywords <code>public</code> (which means that it is a publicly visible method) and <code>static</code> (which means that it belongs to no specific instance of any class) does not somehow make the code \"inaccessible\" to readers. Do you want to see what it would look like if I really ''did'' use Java-specific code? This is the same example using Java streams, and the logic has changed completely.\n:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic static int findLargestValue(int[] list) {\n    return Arrays.stream(list)\n        .reduce((a, b) -> a > b ? a : b)\n        .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException(\"Array is empty\"));\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n:* {{tq|Algorithms are language Independent.}} Meanwhile, the pseudocode examples in the article, are NOT language-independent. You will see that certain syntax choices, such as array slicing (<code>key[1:]</code>, etc.) are very much Python syntax and not some \"generic\" pseudocode that could be any language theoretically. Furthermore, the pseudocode example shows no types for variables, parameters, or functions. If anything, this is precisely obscuring important details from a reader for no good reason. If you want truly \"language-independent\" pseudocode, just write the algorithm in plain English, with a few algorithmic concepts, just don't bother using programming language-resemblant syntax at all.\n:* {{tq|The proposed Java implementation results in superfluous keywords}} and the pseudocode example does not?

While the indexed approach may not be an issue for relatively shallow tries using ASCII (ie, the example at the top of the page), it will quickly become an issue with deep tries and/or large value spaces (eg, Unicode).

This will never finds strings that are prefixes of other strings that are also stored in the trie. Am I mistaken?\n*That's exactly what I thought. I think the other algorithm was actually wrong entirely, since it would only match true if there was a NULL node (no node at all) for the end of the word. I've made the correction of adding a \"terminal\" field which denotes the end of a word. &mdash;[[User:EatMyShortz|EatMyShortz]] 13:52, 30 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n\n\n\"Average lookup speed is theoretically the same, but a trie is faster in practice.\"\nThat seems like a highly dubious claim, unsupported by evidence! In my experience the opposite is usually true (the main benefit of tries is thus that it can grow easily, and it may take less space since prefixes of keys are shared).\n* The performance is highly related to the usage pattern.  In a hashtable, you can retrieve a value while touching only in 1-2 cache lines on average, whereas in a trie this can be upto its depth (length of the prefix).  However, a HT will almost always require these cache fetches whereas especially in a tight loop the trie will often have most or all of the lines cached (and esp for negative results). --[[User:66.7.145.210|66.7.145.210]] 18:27, 5 October 2006 (UTC)\n** Also as I know, a hashtable lookup requires the search-key to be hashed before while the lookup in a trie can start almost instantly.

If you are going to take the length of keys into account when discussing the complexity of lookup with tries then you should do the same with the other methods --otherwise you are comparing apples to oranges. Normally in discussing binary trees and hash tables, it is assumed that the keys are small constant-sized objects. When discussing tries, you have to think of strings. In this case, each comparison in a binary-tree search is a O(m) string compare so the complexity of the lookup is not O(log n) but O(log n*m). Similarly, the expected lookup time for a hash table is O(m), not O(1) because forming the hash typically takes O(m) time (you can avoid looking at all characters, but that probably effects the expected lookup time). --David Gudeman  <small>\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.181.140.228|69.181.140.228]] ([[User talk:69.181.140.228|talk]]) 04:22, 14 July 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n:You are correct about apples and oranges. However, your calculation of the complexity of a trie lookup is wrong. It is O(m), not O(m logn). In fact, to be more precise, it is O(m*p), where p is the number of letters in the alphabet. The number of words that are already in the trie (n) is completely irrelevant. More so than for hash tables, whose lookup complexity is not completely independent from n, due to the possibility of collisions. This cannot be captured nicely in a formula, so we simply say that hash table lookups are O(m).\n:In any case, I was very surprised to see that complexity information is completely missing from the article!

The use of numbers may not have been the most effective way to make their point, which is that only nodes with valid keys store values. Notice that the \"t\" and \"te\" nodes are not marked with numbers. This is because \"t\" and \"te\" are not real English words; therefore, they cannot serve as keys to any value (this _seems_ to be the idea).

[[User:Danielx|Danielx]] 08:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nI agree with Danielx about the meaning of the numbers (i.e. they are merely arbitrary \"values\" associated with the string \"keys\"). However I have a problem with the diagram caption. Since, as Danielx points out, \"t\" and \"te\" are not marked with numbers then they are not \"keys\", but just key prefixes.

When a trie represents overlapping strings, such as, \"the\", and, \"there\", the word, \"the\", will be associated with an interior node of the trie and will be encountered first and be printed first in a preorder traversal before the preorder traversal reaches the node that is associated with the word, \"there\", which itself might be associated with an interior node if there is a longer overlapping string represented by the trie, such as, \"therefore\".\n\nWhether or not a postorder traversal of a trie will produce text in reverse lexicographic order depends on how the strings are represented.

In-order traversal is another kind of depth-first traversal that is more appropriate for outputting the values that are in a binary search tree rather than a trie.\nare confusing.  Should one of them be breath-first traversal?  [[User:Kowloonese|Kowloonese]] ([[User talk:Kowloonese|talk]]) 17:37, 30 October 2009 (UTC)\n\nBreadth-first traversal of a trie would work if you are representing the digits of integers with variable lengths as paths in a trie.  I have no citation for this, just my original insight.  Otherwise, a depth-first traversal would be appropriate.\n\nIn a binary search tree, any descendant nodes down to the left branch of a given parent node contain values that are lower than the value in the parent node, and any descendant nodes down to the right branch of a given parent node contain values that are higher than the value in the parent node.  For the strings, \"The\", \"There\", and, \"Therefore\", the word, \"There\", might be in the root node, and the word, \"The\", might be in the left child node, and, the word, \"Therefore\", might be in the right child node.  Imagine there is a line connecting, \"There\", with, \"The\".  Imagine there is another line connecting, \"There\", with, \"Therefore\":\n\n::There\n:The  Therefore\n\nAn in-order traversal is usually implemented as a recursive depth-first traversal algorithm that attempts to go as far down the left branches of a binary tree as a possible.  Upon returning from a visit down a left branch, the contents of the current node are printed.  Then, the algorithm attempts to recursively go down the right branch.  Pseudocode for an in-order traversal is:\n\n:Procedure InOrder(p as Pointer)<br>\n:Begin\n::If p is Null Then Return\n::InOrder(p->Left)\n::Print p->String\n::InOrder(p->Right)\n:End\n\nSo, in this example, the InOrder() procedure would be called with a pointer to the root node, which contains the value, \"There.\"  The procedure recursively calls itself with a pointer to the left node.  The second instance of the procedure corresponds to the left child node that contains, \"The\".  This instance of the procedure then calls itself recursively with a Null pointer for the left node.  The third instance of the procedure then immediately returns, because the pointer is Null.  Upon returning from the left branch, the second instance of the procedure prints the contents of the current node, \"The\".  The second instance of the procedure then recursively calls itself with a Null pointer to the right branch.  The fourth instance of the procedure immediately returns to the second instance of the procedure, because the pointer is Null.  Upon returning from the right branch, the second instance of the procedure then returns to the first instance of the procedure which corresponds to the root node.  Upon returning from the left branch, the first instance of the procedure prints the contents of the root node, \"There.\"  The first instance of the procedure then recursively calls a fifth instance of the procedure with a pointer to the right node, which contains, \"Therefore\".  The fifth instance of the procedure then recursively calls itself with a Null pointer to the left node.  The sixth instance of the procedure immediately returns, since the pointer is Null.  Upon returning from the left branch, the fifth instance of the procedure then prints the value in the current node, \"Therefore\".  The fifth instance of the procedure then recursively calls itself with a Null pointer to the right node.  The seventh instance of the procedure then immediately returns, since the pointer is Null.  Upon returning from the right branch, the fifth instance of the procedure that corresponds to the word, \"Therefore\", then returns to the first instance of the procedure corresponding to the root node.  Upon returning from visiting the right branch, the first instance of the procedure corresponding to the root node then returns, finishing the in-order traversal.\n\nA preorder traversal prints or otherwise processes the value associated with the current node in a tree first before visiting any descendant nodes.  That is what has to be done to print in ascending lexicographic order the values represented by a trie where the strings:\n\n:The<br>\n:There<br>\n:Therefore<br>\n\nare arranged as overlapping paths in the trie where the paths represent the individual digits or individual characters of the string prefixes.  There are multiple options for how to represent the strings.  For example, you can concatenate the string prefixes that are represented by a path that has been traversed from the root node down to a given node or have a pointer to a string in each node that corresponds to the path that has been traversed from the root node down to a given node.  A trie doesn't have to be a binary trie, but if it were a binary trie, the pseudocode for a preorder traversal would be something like:\n\n:Procedure PreOrder(p as Pointer)<br>\n:Begin\n::If p is Null then Return\n::Print p->String\n::PreOrder(p->Pointer[0]) 'Recursively visit any nodes down the branch corresponding to string prefix digit zero.\n::PreOrder(p->Pointer[1]) 'Recursively visit any nodes down the branch corresponding to string prefix digit one.\n:End\n\nA postorder traversal routine goes as deep as possible down a particular branch of a tree until no further descent is possible and then switches to the next available branch, recursively going down until no further descent is possible for any branch, and prints or otherwise processes the contents of the current node prior to returning.  The text book version of postorder traversal that I learned depicted visiting the branches from the left to right, but for displaying the values associated with a trie in descending lexicographic order, the branches have to be visited from right to left, corresponding to the higher digital values to the lower digital values.  The pseudocode for a postorder traveral of a binary trie would be something like:\n\n:Procedure PostOrder(p as Pointer)<br>\n:Begin\n::if p is Null then Return\n::PostOrder(p->Pointer[1]) 'Recursively visit any nodes down the branch corresponding to string prefix digit one.\n::PostOrder(p->Pointer[0]) 'Recursively visit any nodes down the branch corresponding to string prefix digit zero.\n::Print p->String\n:End\n\nIn-order traversal, preorder traversal, and postorder traversal are all depth-first traversal algorithms.  I don't like using hyphens for spelling pre-order or post-order traversal, because it takes too long to type.  If you visualize in your mind the sequence of nodes that are visited by these recursive algorithms, then you will see that depth-first traversal is equivalent to the wall following algorithm for traversing a maze by keeping one of your hands on a wall at all times, which will make the maze traveler visit all of the maze if there is no exit.  You can see examples of real preorder and postorder traversal routines for a binary trie in the C language source code for my BRADSORT program, which is one of the first implementations of a trie-based radix sorting algorithm, which you can probably find with Google.

The advantages of tries over hash tables here are: 1. They often take less memory (as whole words aren't stored), 2. They are MUCH faster to build given a sorted word list (as well as easily saving a sorted word list), 3.

As for in-order vs. pre-order, that makes no difference if you want to output only the keys, but if you want to output all their prefixes, you need to do it pre-order. The algorithm is as follows:\n\n traverse(n : Trie node, s : string)\n     if n is a final node:\n         output s\n     for each symbol c of the trie's alphabet, in order:\n         if there is a child node of t associated with c:\n             traverse(child c of n, s + c)\n\n:Skipping the check for final nodes produces the prefixes as well.

A baseline implementation of a trie node in C would be\n\n        struct Node {\n            int final;\n            struct Node *children[256];\n        };\n\n::A node <code>n</code> has a child for symbol <code>c</code> iff <code>n.children[c] != NULL</code>.

My reasoning is as follows:\n* This pseudocode is less descriptive. It does not present types and relies on syntactic quirks of other languages that ironically, make it less universal. For example, in the removal method, <code>key[1:]</code> is an inherently Python-esque syntax. It also introduces <code>:=</code> while using <code>=</code> for equality checking, etc. There are also places where it relies on implicit (rather than explicit) constructs, like <code>Node()</code> (which probably refers to calling a constructor, but isn't defined anywhere).\n* The claim that Java is more verbose or more noisy is inherently not true. This is not even opinion, but the pseudocode examples introduce noise keyword like \"then\", \"do\", \"repeat\", \"end\", etc. At that point why not just omit those keywords and rely on Python-style indentation, which is just as descriptive on where scope begins and ends? Furthermore, making the parameter <code>x</code> explicit is also additional noise when it could much more simply just be expressed as a method of the structure on itself.\n* Java (at the very least, in my opinion) has very simple syntax, and I don't see how the pseudocode provided is somehow more descriptive than the Java examples (in my opinion it is less descriptive but this is my opinion)\n* The claim that \"pseudocode has a wider appeal\" is inherently meaningless because pseudocode is not an actual language. If the pseudocode isn't any more descriptive or simple than a real code example, at that point, why not just write the instructions in English? It feels like pseudocode is being used here just for the sake of using pseudocode. Nothing is gained from using it (it's not \"easier to read\" nor is it \"syntactically simpler\", it is being chosen simply for not being an actual language, etc.)\n* Concrete code examples are not only better but can be demonstrated on the user's end if they choose to compile and produce the code themselves.\n* The pseudocode examples are more tedious and difficult to maintain. Keywords are manually bolded and line counts are manually written rather than automatically generated.\nI also wish to bring the attention that the code was previously written in Python (and there was a second implementation in Go, which was removed for being extraneous which I agree with) but was unilaterally changed to pseudocode by [[User:WikiLinuz]], without any talk.

The proposed Java implementation results in superfluous keywords (<code>public</code>, <code>static</code>) and particular choices such as privileging the ASCII lowercase alphabet.  None of these aid the reader's understanding of the topic compared to a clean, language-independent presentation of the ideas. [[User:Elestrophe|Elestrophe]] ([[User talk:Elestrophe|talk]]) 18:04, 27 November 2025 (UTC)\n:Let me address each of these points yet again, despite having addressed these exact points repeatedly in the discussion above:\n:* {{tq|Java is just one language.}} But its syntax is not, it is universally understood. To give an example of exactly what I mean, let us take a look at this simple algorithm that finds the largest value in a list, using the same pseudocode style as the article. As you have declared your proficiency in computer science, I am sure you are aware of exactly what is happening in the following code.\n:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"py\">\nfindLargestValue(list):\n    if not list or list.length == 0 then\n        raise IllegalArgumentException(\"Array is empty\")\n    end if\n    largest := list[0]\n    for i in list do\n        if list[i] > largest then\n            largest = list[i]\n        end if\n    repeat\n    return largest\n</syntaxhighlight>\n:: Meanwhile, in Java:\n:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\npublic static int findLargestValue(int[] list) {\n    if (list == null || list.length == 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Array is empty\");\n    }\n    int largest = list[0];\n    for (int i: list) {\n        if (list[i] > largest) {\n            largest = list[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return largest;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n:: The logic is expressed in exactly the same way. There are no Java-specific quirks in the Java snippet. Just because it contains the keywords <code>public</code> (which means that it is a publicly visible method) and <code>static</code> (which means that it belongs to no specific instance of any class) does not somehow make the code \"inaccessible\" to readers. Do you want to see what it would look like if I really ''did'' use Java-specific code? This is the same example using Java streams, and the logic has changed completely.\n:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"java\">\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic static int findLargestValue(int[] list) {\n    return Arrays.stream(list)\n        .reduce((a, b) -> a > b ? a : b)\n        .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException(\"Array is empty\"));\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n:* {{tq|Algorithms are language Independent.}} Meanwhile, the pseudocode examples in the article, are NOT language-independent. You will see that certain syntax choices, such as array slicing (<code>key[1:]</code>, etc.) are very much Python syntax and not some \"generic\" pseudocode that could be any language theoretically. Furthermore, the pseudocode example shows no types for variables, parameters, or functions. If anything, this is precisely obscuring important details from a reader for no good reason. If you want truly \"language-independent\" pseudocode, just write the algorithm in plain English, with a few algorithmic concepts, just don't bother using programming language-resemblant syntax at all.\n:* {{tq|The proposed Java implementation results in superfluous keywords}} and the pseudocode example does not? What do words like <code>do</code>, <code>then</code>, <code>end if</code>, <code>repeat</code>, etc. add to the understanding of the algorithm? It is quite literally noise that languages have evolved the use of brackets for now. \n:* {{tq|particular choices such as privileging the ASCII lowercase alphabet}} If you're so insistent on \"not using any particular alphabet\", then at least write something in the pseudocode that gives an inherent indication of this to the reader. Meanwhile in the proposed Java implementation I specifically left a comment saying that the size of the alphabet can be chosen depending on ''what'' alphabet is chosen. Just because the lowercase ASCII alphabet was chosen for the code, does not mean it is the ''only'' valid alphabet to choose, it is merely an example. Why do you assume readers are not intelligent enough to extrapolate this constant to whatever alphabet of their choosing? Frankly I'm not sure what the obsession with this point of contention is, when it's so obviously hardly relevant to anything.\n:[[Special:Contributions/&#126;2025-36699-87|&#126;2025-36699-87]] ([[User talk:&#126;2025-36699-87|talk]]) 22:44, 27 November 2025 (UTC)\n::At this point your only option is doing an Rfc, given that 3rd opinion consensus is not with you, regardless of your explanations.

This can intentionally be left as a comment.\n** Use syntax quirks that do not belong to any language. Right now I am drawing attention to string slicing syntax which is obviously Python-inspired, but is not universally obvious.\n** Replace <code>x</code> in the parameters with something like <code>this</code> or <code>self</code>.

I don't think the Java example is the solution, though, unless it explicitly stated something like ''key.substring(1, key.length - 1)'' (although in Java it is still too slow).\n::{{tqb|Replace <code>x</code> in the parameters with something like <code>this</code> or <code>self</code>.}}\n::This is only helpful for people familiar with the jargon.\n::All that said, I think this discussion will need to be repeat when a new version of the code has been written. So, while it is a bit much to call this a waste of time, I think we are duplicating work by doing this in the wrong order.\n::In my Sandbox [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ergur/sandbox] I have 2 possible versions to work from. The first is adding onto the current version, with few alterations. The second is a higher level approach I thought my warrant a look too. They aren't quite finished. I will work more on them tomorrow morning; It is night now. \u2014 xo [[User:Ergur|<span style=\"color:orange;\">'''Ergur'''</span>]] ([[User talk:Example|talk]]) 00:22, 1 December 2025 (UTC)\n:::I don't see why using generics or labeling the stored type as <code>T</code> is a problem. If it's a problem that we gave an explicit size for the alphabet size, then it shouldn't be a problem if we don't specify <code>T</code>, most people are capable of comprehending tparams or are conscious of what they would denote.

There are plenty of other articles on Wikipedia that use pseudocode that do not use keywords to close scopes, and it's usually pretty easy to associate each scope closer with the block it belongs to. As mentioned by the [[WP:3O]] earlier in the talk section, [[MOS:ALGO]] is a suggestion, not a hard rule.

The arguments you are making would apply equally well to any algorithms article, so you should open an RFC to change [[MOS:ALGO]] instead of trying to override it one article at a time. [[User:Elestrophe|Elestrophe]] ([[User talk:Elestrophe|talk]]) 09:11, 29 November 2025 (UTC)\n:::Also to be clear [[MOS:ALGO]] states {{tq|If sufficiently clear, block closing keywords (end, repeat etc.) may be omitted.}} So it's fine to omit the ending keywords, but I don't think replacing them with braces is constructive.
